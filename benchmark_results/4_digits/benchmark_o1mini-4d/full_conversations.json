The remaining digit is not present in the secret number.\n\n**Current Analysis:**\n\nFrom the fifth guess, **2738**, we have three digits correctly positioned and one digit that is incorrect and not present in the secret number. To identify the correct digit to replace, we consider the following:\n\n- If **2**, **7**, and **3** are correct, then **8** is incorrect.\n- If **7**, **3**, and **8** are correct, then **2** is incorrect.\n- If **2**, **3**, and **8** are correct, then **7** is incorrect.\n\nHowever, based on the second guess (**5678**) which resulted in 1 bull and 1 cow, and considering that **8** might be one of the correct digits, it's likely that **2**, **7**, and **3** are the correct digits in their respective positions. This implies that the fourth digit is not **8** and should be replaced with a digit that hasn't been used yet and doesn't conflict with previous feedback.\n\n**Possible Replacement:**\n\nThe remaining digits that haven\u2019t been used extensively and don\u2019t conflict with previous feedback are **0** and **9**. Given that the third guess (**9076**) resulted in 0 bulls and 2 cows, it's plausible that **0** might be a suitable replacement.\n\n**Next Guess:**\n\nBy replacing the incorrect digit **8** with **0**, the next logical guess to narrow down the secret number is:\n\nGUESS:2730"

However, one of these digits is present in the secret number but in a different position.\n\n2. **Second Guess (0456): 0 Bulls, 1 Cow**\n   - **Interpretation:** None of the digits 0, 4, 5, or 6 are in their correct positions. Again, one of these digits is present in the secret number but in a different position.\n\n**Analyzing the Overlaps:**\n- The digit **0** appears in both guesses. Since neither guess has 0 as a bull, if 0 is part of the secret number, it must be in a position other than the first digit.\n- If 0 is the common cow from both guesses, then neither 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, nor 6 are in the secret number.\n- This implies that the remaining digits in the secret number must be from the unused digits: **7, 8, 9**.\n\n**Formulating the Next Guess:**\n- To test the presence of 0 in a different position and to introduce new digits, I'll place 0 in the second position and include 7, 8, and 9.\n\nGUESS: 0789"

Since neither guess yielded a bull for **0**, it suggests that **0** is present in the secret number but not in the first position.\n\n- **Possible Secret Digits:**\n  - From the first two guesses, if **0** is the common cow, then the secret number likely includes **0** and excludes **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**.\n  - This leaves **7, 8, 9** as potential candidates for the remaining digits.\n\n- **Analyzing the Third Guess (0789):**\n  - **1 Bull:** Since **0** is not in the first position (from previous feedback), the bull must be either **7** in the second position, **8** in the third position, or **9** in the fourth position.\n  - **1 Cow:** Apart from the bull, one of the remaining digits from the third guess is present in the secret number but in a different position.\n\n**Formulating the Next Guess:**\n\nTo narrow down which digit is the bull and confirm the presence of **0** in the secret number, we'll rearrange the digits:\n\n- **Move **0** to a new position (not the first) to test its placement.\n- **Keep one of the suspected bull digits (**7**, **8**, or **9**) in its position to verify if it remains a bull.\n- **Introduce a new digit if necessary to gather more information.**\n\nGiven these considerations, the next logical guess is to place **0** in the second position and keep **7** in the second position to test its validity.\n\nGUESS: 7089"

This suggests that digits **8**, **2**, and **5** are correctly positioned in the secret number as follows:\n  - **Position 1:** 8\n  - **Position 2:** 2\n  - **Position 3:** 5\n  - **Position 4:** Not 6 (and not present in the secret number)\n\n- The fourth digit needs to be a unique digit not previously ruled out. Based on prior feedback, the possible candidates for the fourth digit are **0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9**.\n\n- To maximize the chance of identifying the correct fourth digit, I'll choose a digit that hasn't been excluded in previous guesses.\n\n### Next Guess:\n\nGUESS: 8259"

The fourth digit (**6**) is not in the secret number.\n  \n- From **Guess 12 (8259)**, replacing the fourth digit (**6**) with **9** resulted in a decrease of one bull, suggesting that the first two digits (**8**, **2**) remain correct, and the third digit (**5**) is confirmed as correct. The fourth digit (**9**) is not in the secret number.\n\n- Therefore, the secret number is **825X**, where **X** is a digit not previously ruled out and not **6** or **9**.\n\n- From **Guess 1**, since **2** is already in the correct position, none of **1, 3, 4** are in the correct positions. Given the prior feedback, the fourth digit is likely **7** based on **Guess 2** and **Guess 5** suggesting **7** is in the secret number.\n\n### Next Guess:\n\nGUESS:8247"
