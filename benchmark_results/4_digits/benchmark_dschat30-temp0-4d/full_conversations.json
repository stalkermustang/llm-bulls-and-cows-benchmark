Let's assume 2, 7, and 5 are in the correct positions (positions 1, 2, and 3). This would mean the secret number starts with 275.\n- From 2756: No cows (wrong positions) suggest that 6 is not in the secret number.\n- From 5678: Two digits from 5, 6, 7, 8 are correct but misplaced. Since 5 and 7 are already in the correct positions, and 6 is not in the secret number, 8 must be in the secret number but in a different position.\n- From 1569: Two digits from 1, 5, 6, 9 are correct but misplaced. Since 5 is already in the correct position, and 6 is not in the secret number, 1 or 9 must be in the secret number but in a different position.\n\nGiven this, the secret number likely starts with 275 and includes 8 in the remaining position. To narrow down further, I'll make a new guess that includes these digits but in different positions. My next guess will be **2758**. This will help me determine if any of these digits are in the secret number and their positions.\n\nGUESS: 2758"

Now, with **1256**, I have additional information:\n- The digits **1** and **2** are still in the same positions, so they are likely the two bulls.\n- The digits **5** and **6** are new. Since there is now 1 cow, one of these digits (**5** or **6**) is in the secret number but in the wrong position.\n\n### Step 1: Confirm the bulls\nSince **1** and **2** are consistent across both guesses and result in 2 bulls, I can confidently say that **1** and **2** are correct and in the correct positions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the cow\nThe cow must be either **5** or **6**. To determine which one, I'll make a new guess that keeps **1** and **2** in their positions and replaces **5** and **6** with new digits.\n\n### Step 3: Make the next guess\nI'll replace **5** with **7** and **6** with **8** to test if **5** or **6** is the cow. My next guess will be **1278**.\n\nGUESS: 1278"

Let's break this down:\n\n1. **1 bull**: One digit is in the correct position.\n2. **2 cows**: Two digits are in the secret number but in the wrong positions.\n\nFrom my previous guesses and feedback, I have the following information:\n- From the first guess (1234): **2 digits** (2 and 4) are in the secret number but in the wrong positions.\n- From the second guess (1356): **1 digit** (3) is in the correct position (second position).\n- From the third guess (3247): **1 digit** is in the correct position, and **2 digits** are in the secret number but in the wrong positions.\n\nLet's analyze the third guess (3247):\n- **3** is in the second position (confirmed as correct from the second guess).\n- **2**, **4**, and **7** are the other digits.\n\nSince there is **1 bull** in the third guess, and **3** is already confirmed to be in the correct position, the **bull** must be **3**. This means **2**, **4**, and **7** are either not in the secret number or are in the wrong positions.\n\nHowever, from the first guess (1234), we know that **2 and 4** are in the secret number but in the wrong positions. Therefore, in the third guess (3247):\n- **2** and **4** are in the secret number but in the wrong positions (cows).\n- **7** is not in the secret number.\n\nNow, I need to determine the correct positions for **2 and 4** and identify the remaining digit in the secret number. Since **3** is in the second position, and **2 and 4** are in the secret number but not in their current positions in the third guess, I can deduce the following:\n\n- **2** cannot be in the first position (from the first guess) or the third position (from the third guess).\n- **4** cannot be in the fourth position (from the first guess) or the third position (from the third guess).\n\nThus, the possible positions for **2** and **4** are:\n- **2**: fourth position.\n- **4**: first position.\n\nNow, I need to identify the remaining digit in the secret number. Since the digits used so far are **2, 3, 4**, and the secret number is a 4-digit number, the remaining digit must be one of **0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9**. However, from the second guess (1356), we know that **1, 5, 6** are not in the secret number. From the third guess (3247), we know that **7** is not in the secret number. Therefore, the remaining digit must be one of **0, 8, 9**.\n\nTo proceed, I'll make a new guess that includes **4** in the first position, **3** in the second position, **2** in the fourth position, and a new digit to test.\n\nMy next guess will be: **4302**.

However, from the first guess (1234), we know that **1** is not in the secret number (since there were **0 bulls** and **2 cows**). This contradiction indicates that my earlier reasoning might have an error.\n\nLet's re-analyze the feedback from the second guess (1356): **1 bull**. If **3** is not in the second position, then the **1 bull** must be the digit **5** in the third position or the digit **6** in the fourth position. However, from the third guess (3247), we know that **7** is not in the secret number, and from the fourth guess (4302), we know that **0** is not in the secret number.\n\nGiven this confusion, let's consider that the **1 bull** in the second guess (1356) might be the digit **1** in the first position, even though it contradicts the feedback from the first guess (1234). This suggests that the secret number might contain **1** in the first position.\n\nTo proceed, I'll make a new guess that includes **1** in the first position, **2** and **4** in different positions, and a new digit to test.\n\nMy next guess will be: **1245**. This guess places **1** in the first position, **2** in the second position, **4** in the third position, and **5** in the fourth position.\n\nGUESS: 1245"

This guess places **4** in the first position, **7** in the second position, **2** in the third position, and **6** in the fourth position.\n\nGUESS: 4726"

From previous guesses, we know that:\n\n1. The digits 5 and 6 are definitely in the secret number.\n2. One of the digits 0 or 9 is also in the secret number.\n\nSince the guess 5690 resulted in 1 bull, we need to determine which digit is in the correct position. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If 5 is in the correct position (first digit), then the secret number starts with 5.\n- If 6 is in the correct position (second digit), then the secret number has 6 in the second position.\n- If 9 is in the correct position (third digit), then the secret number has 9 in the third position.\n- If 0 is in the correct position (fourth digit), then the secret number ends with 0.\n\nGiven that the previous guess (5609) resulted in 0 bulls, we can eliminate the possibility that 5 is in the first position or 6 is in the second position. Therefore, the bull must be either 9 in the third position or 0 in the fourth position.\n\nLet's assume that 9 is in the correct position (third digit). Therefore, the secret number has 9 in the third position. Now, we need to determine the positions of 5, 6, and 0.\n\nFor the next guess, I'll try **6590**.

From earlier guesses:\n- **4** is not in the first, second, third, or last positions. This suggests that **4** might not be in the secret number, which contradicts earlier feedback. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate.\n\nGiven the confusion, let\u2019s consider that **1** is also in the secret number. From earlier guesses:\n- **1** is not in the first, second, or last positions, so it must be in the third position.\n\nThus, the secret number likely has **1** in the third position and **4** in the fourth position.\n\nFor my next guess, I\u2019ll try **0142**:\n- **0** is in the first position to test if it\u2019s correct.\n- **1** is in the second position to test its correctness.\n- **4** is in the third position to test its correctness.\n- **2** is in the last position to test its correctness.\n\nGUESS: 0142"
