But 6519 had already yielded 2 bulls so both 6 and 5 must exist - in correct positions and together somewhere in the number so 0 bulls with 5690 is confusing. Now since it led to 0 bulls, it also suggest that none of the four digits are in their correct position thus 6 cannot be in the first or 2nd position. We already knew 5 isn't there in 2nd position from previous guesses.\n\nSo let's fix 65 - Since now I am more inclined to beleive 65 can be together, I will fix 65 and permute 90 with them. So if 6 is fixed in position 1, 5 will come after position 2.

From 6249, the three numbers in the positions 6 2 4 were cows (belong to number) and in the position 9, which resulted in a cow meaning that 9 belongs in the number but obviously not at the position used in this combination (6249). This can only mean that the position of nine wasn\u2019t tested in the guess 6249 but 6, 2, 4, were tested in wrong positions. From trying 2496 and getting two bulls again with 2469 and getting one bull means that nine could be at the end.

Let's try swapping 9 to see which position it fits into. Since 2 and 4 provided a bull previously and swapping 5 and 9 got 3 bulls, It seems the issue lies with 5.  Let's swap the positions of 5 and 9. Since one of the previous guesses included zero, we can exclude 0 from our possible guesses, and since we know 5 and 9 are correct digits let's substitute 5 for an earlier used digit. Using the information from guess 2409 yeilding 1 bull and 2 cows suggests 4 or 2 is in the correct position and we know either 9 or 0 is the cow. Trying 9402\n\nGUESS: 9402\n"

Re-evaluating after this since it said 3 cows no bulls, since it states 3 cows and 0 but 4,2,5,9 are present, 0 is incorrect. So instead of 0 lets take one of the earlier assumed cows which could either be 0 or 9. This has been the confusing part, swapping those positions now. Using the most recent bull info 4529 where 4,5 and 2 were correct positions, lets see what swapping 2 and 9 yields.\n\nGUESS: 4592\n"
