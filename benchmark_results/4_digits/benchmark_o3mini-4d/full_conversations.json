Notice that the digit 2 appears in both groups. This leads us to two potential scenarios for the candidate from the first group:\n\u2003\u2022 Either the one digit from {0,1,2,3} is 2 (which would then be one of our two from {2,4,5,6} \u2013 meaning the secret would then contain 2 plus one more from {4,5,6}),\n\u2003\u2022 Or it is one of 0, 1, or 3 (so in this case the two digits from the second guess would come solely from {4,5,6}, and 2 would not be in the secret).\n\nMy plan now is to include digit 2 (to test if it is that common candidate), one choice from the remaining {0,1,3} \u2013 I\u2019ll use 1, and also include a candidate from the set {4,5,6} \u2013 I\u2019ll choose 4, then add one completely new digit (7) so we start testing outside of the previous guesses. \n\nWe must be careful with placement: for digit 2, we cannot use positions 2 (from guess 0123) or 0 (from guess 2456), so I\u2019ll put it in position 1; for digit 1, it shouldn\u2019t be in position 1 (since it was there in guess 0123), so I\u2019ll assign it to position 0; for digit 4, recall it was in position 1 in guess 2456, so I\u2019ll move it to position 2; and 7 is new so it can go anywhere, so I\u2019ll put it in position 3.\n\nThus the next guess is 1-2-4-7 (1247). The feedback will help us decide if digit 2 is indeed in the secret or if the digit from {0,1,3} is 1 (and consequently 2 is not present). \n\nGUESS: 1247"

        "content": "Our goal is now to test whether digit 2 (the common candidate from previous guesses) is actually in the secret. Recall:\n\u2022 Guess1 (0123) told us exactly one digit from {0,1,2,3} is present. That candidate is either 2 or one of {0,1,3}.\n\u2022 Guess2 (2456) told us exactly two digits from {2,4,5,6} are present. So if 2 is the candidate from Guess1, then one more digit among {4,5,6} is in the secret; if not, then the two digits come solely from {4,5,6}.\n\u2022 Guess3 (1247) again yielded 0 bulls and 2 cows. In one scenario (let\u2019s call it Scenario A) the secret contains 2 (and likely 4) while in the alternative (Scenario B) it contains 1 (from Guess1) and 4 from Guess2.\n\nWe can distinguish between these scenarios by forcing digit 2 into its only allowed position if it is present. (From earlier feedback, if 2 is in the secret it cannot be in the same positions it appeared in prior guesses: it was in position 2 in Guess1, position 0 in Guess2, and position 1 in Guess3. Thus in Scenario A digit 2 must be at position 3.)\n\nI propose the next guess: 8 in position 0, 1 in position 1, 4 in position 2, and 2 in position 3 (i.e. 8-1-4-2). Let\u2019s see how the feedback would differ:\n\u2022 In Scenario A (secret contains 2 and 4, but not 1), comparing guess 8,1,4,2 to the secret:\n\u2003\u2013 The 2 in position 3 will be a bull (because if 2 is included it must be in position 3).\n\u2003\u2013 The 4, though present, is placed at position 2 while secret\u2019s allowed positions for 4 are only index0 or index3 (from earlier guesses), so it becomes a cow.\n\u2003\u2013 The digits 8 and 1 should be absent.\n\u2003This would yield 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\u2022 In Scenario B (secret contains 1 and 4, but not 2):\n\u2003\u2013 The 2 (at position 3) would be absent.\n\u2003\u2013 The 1, if present, must be in allowed positions (indices 2 or 3 based on earlier information), so with it placed at index1 in our guess it gives a cow.\n\u2003\u2013 The 4, again forced to be in index0 or index3 if present, placed at index2 gives a cow.\n\u2003\u2013 8 is absent.\n\u2003This would yield 0 bulls and 2 cows.\n\nThus, the feedback on this guess will let us tell whether 2 is in the secret (Scenario A) or not (Scenario B).\n\nGUESS: 8142"

        "content": "Our deductions have led us to narrow the secret\u2019s digits down to four numbers. Here\u2019s what we know from all previous feedback:\n\n\u2022 From 0123 (0 bulls, 1 cow), exactly one digit from {0,1,2,3} is in the secret. Since digit 2 cannot be in the secret (because every guess placing 2 in a different position yielded 0 bulls), the candidate from this set must be either 0, 1, or 3.\n\n\u2022 From 2456 (0 bulls, 2 cows) and knowing 2 is ruled out, exactly two digits from {4,5,6} are in the secret. Their common element with our later guesses turns out to be 4. (In fact, comparing with the next steps, 4 appears in all intersections, so it must be in the secret.) That leaves the other digit from {4,5,6} to be either 5 or 6.\n\n\u2022 From 1247 (0 bulls, 2 cows) and 8142 (0 bulls, 2 cows), comparing intersections with {1,2,4,7} and {8,1,4,2} \u2013 eliminating 2 \u2013 forces the other certain intersection to be {1,4}. Since we already have 4, it follows that 1 must be in the secret. (The candidate in {0,1,3} is thus 1.)\n\nSo at this point the secret\u2019s digit set is forced to be exactly {1,4,9,?} because there is only one digit left \u201coutside\u201d these intersections. Notice that the union of the four digits coming from the tested sets (namely {0,1,2,3}, {2,4,5,6}, {1,2,4,7} and {8,1,4,2}) covers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Since all feedback counts are exact, the only remaining digit that can \u201cfill the gap\u201d is 9. In addition, from {4,5,6} we already have 4, so the other digit from that set must come from {5,6}. Thus the secret must be composed of 1, 4, 9 and either 5 or 6.\n\nTo determine which candidate from {5,6} is correct, we can design a guess that tests the presence of 6. Notice that if the secret includes 6 then its digit set is {1,4,6,9} (i.e. all guessed digits in our next attempt), and if not then the secret\u2019s set is {1,4,5,9} (yielding only three shared digits with a guess that includes 6).\n\nI propose using the guess 4916 arranged as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 Place 4 at position 0 (allowed since guess2 had 4 at position 1 and guess3/4 had 4 in position 2).\n\u2003\u2022 Place 9 at position 1 (9 is new, so no restrictions).\n\u2003\u2022 Place 1 at position 2 (1 was previously at positions 0 and 1 in earlier guesses, so pos2 is allowed).\n\u2003\u2022 Place 6 at position 3 (if 6 is in the secret it cannot be in position 3 based on guess2, so if we get overall four matches it tells us 6 is present).\n\nNow, if the secret\u2019s set is {1,4,6,9} the guess 4916 will match all four digits (yielding a total of 4 matches, with bulls depending on placement) whereas if the secret is {1,4,5,9} then the intersection with 4916 is only {1,4,9} (three digits). The resulting total count (bulls plus cows) will let us distinguish which candidate is in the secret.\n\nGUESS: 4916"

For example, let\u2019s consider the guess 1694.

Here\u2019s a brief recap of our logic:\n\n\u2022 In 0123 we got 0 bulls, 1 cow, meaning exactly one digit among {0,1,2,3} is in the secret. Since our eventual candidate set does not include 0, that one must be 3 (not 1 or 2, as they must be ruled out later).\n\n\u2022 In 4056 we received 0 bulls, 1 cow, so exactly one digit from {4,0,5,6} is in the secret. With 0 ruled out and 5 later eliminated by other responses, the candidate here is 6.\n\n\u2022 In 7890, 0 bulls and 2 cows told us that exactly two digits from {7,8,9,0} appear in the secret. With 0 out and 9 not showing up in the other clues, the two are 7 and 8.\n\n\u2022 In 1478 we got 0 bulls, 2 cows. The only common digits from that guess with our candidate set are 7 and 8; they must both be present but in different positions than in 1478 (which had 7 in third position and 8 in fourth).\n\n\u2022 Finally, in 7285 our guess produced 1 bull and 1 cow. Given that 7, 2, 8, 5 are in the guess and our candidate digits include 7 and 8 (with 2 and 5 eliminated from previous elimination, since otherwise the intersection count would be higher), one of 7 or 8 must be exactly positioned (bull) and the other present elsewhere (cow). Analyzing the other position prohibitions (for instance, from 7890 and 1478) forces 8 to be in third position (since in 7285 the only possible bull is if the third digit, 8, is in its correct place) and 7 in a different spot (not pos1 because in 7890, 7 in pos1 would have given a bull).\n\nOne more observation came from \u201c0123\u201d and \u201c4056\u201d: neither 3 nor 6 can occupy their fourth positions (since that would have given bulls in those guesses when 3 is in pos4 of 0123 or 6 is in pos4 of 4056). With the forced placement in 7285, and the conditions from 1478 (7 cannot be in pos3 and 8 cannot be in pos4), the only consistent arrangement is to have 8 in position 3 and 7 in position 4. That leaves positions 1 and 2 for 3 and 6; either order yields the same hit counts so far. I\u2019ll choose one consistent arrangement: 3 in pos1 and 6 in pos2.\n\nThus our candidate secret number is 3,6,8,7. I propose the next guess as:\n\nGUESS: 3687"

The consistent solution turns out to be that the secret\u2019s digits (in some order) are from:\n\u2003\u2022 Exactly one from {1,2,3} \u2013 we find that 2 works.\n\u2003\u2022 Exactly one from {4,0,5,6} \u2013 here 4 appears.\n\u2003\u2022 And exactly two from {7,8,9,0} \u2013 and from the other constraints these turn out to be 7 and 9.\nIn addition, the last guess (3687) tells us that the only matching digit from {3,6,8,7} is 7, and it must be exactly in the right spot (position 4, as 7 is the only candidate that can match in that guess).\n\nWorking through positions using the bull restrictions from earlier guesses\u2014for example, 4056 ruled out 4 in position1 and 1478 ruled out 4 in pos2\u2014leads to placing 4 in position 3. With 7 fixed in position 4 (from guess 3687) and having one candidate from {1,2,3} (which must be 2 to satisfy the count in guess 0123) and one candidate from {4,0,5,6} already set to 4, our two remaining digits among the two from {7,8,9} must be 7 and 9. With 7 already in pos4, the other one is 9. Finally, placing 2 and 9 in positions1 and 2 while obeying clues (for instance, guess7285 requires that 2 appears as a bull if in position2 while 7 is counted as a mispositioned cow) yields the only arrangement:\n\nPosition1: 9\nPosition2: 2\nPosition3: 4\nPosition4: 7\n\nThis secret number 9247 satisfies:\n\u2003\u2013 0123 gives only the digit 2 (in secret pos2 \u2260 guess pos3) \u2192 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 4056 gives only 4 (in secret pos3 \u2260 guess pos1) \u2192 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 7890 gives 9 and 7 as cows.\n\u2003\u2013 1478 gives 4 and 7 as cows.\n\u2003\u2013 7285 gives 2 as a bull (secret pos2 = guess pos2) and 7 as a cow.\n\u2003\u2013 3687 gives 7 exactly in the right place (secret pos4 = guess pos4) and no other overlap.\n\nThus the next guess is:\n\nGUESS: 9247"

Here\u2019s a summary under our current working assumptions with 8 as the candidate from guess 6 (in 3687, where only one digit in that guess is correct and in position):\n\n\u2022 Guess 6 (3687, 1 bull, 0 cows) tells us that among {3,6,8,7} exactly one digit is in the secret and it\u2019s exactly placed. We choose 8 as that digit and place it in position 3.\n\u2022 Guess 1 (0123, 0 bulls, 1 cow) means exactly one digit among {0,1,2,3} is in the secret. With 3 ruled out from guess 6 and no other clues favoring 0, a likely candidate is 1 (or 2), but we will see how the other clues line up.\n\u2022 Guess 2 (4056, 0 bulls, 1 cow) indicates that among {4,0,5,6} exactly one digit is present. With 6 ruled out by our guess 6 assumption and 0 being a possible candidate but less favored by other groups, we lean toward 5 or 4.\n\u2022 Guess 3 (7890, 0 bulls, 2 cows) shows that two digits among {7,8,9,0} are present. We already have 8; therefore one more from {9,0} must be in the secret.\n\u2022 Guess 4 (1478, 0 bulls, 2 cows) tells us that two digits among {1,4,7,8} are present. With 8 present from guess 6 and 7 not showing up in our other deductions, it must be that one of {1,4} is present in addition to 8.\n\u2022 Guess 5 (7285, 1 bull, 1 cow) has digits {7,2,8,5}. We already know that our secret has 8 in position 3 (because that guess shows 8 in pos3 giving a bull if that\u2019s correct), so the extra matching digit here must be 5 or 2. But if we pick 2 from guess 5, then we must reconcile it with guess 1 (which would then have two possible candidates from {1,2,?}), so 5 is a stronger candidate.\n\u2022 Finally, Guess 7 (9247, 0 bulls, 1 cow) involves digits {9,2,4,7}. Its single match forces the only candidate from this set to be 9 (if we select 2 or 4 we\u2019d conflict with other group counts).\n\nThus a consistent candidate set is {1,5,8,9}.\n\nNow we assign positions knowing:\n\u2013 The secret is 4 distinct digits.\n\u2013 From guess 6, we place 8 in position 3 (because in 3687, only 8 yields the bull).\n\u2013 From guess 1 (0123, matching only one digit among {0,1,2,3}), the only candidate in our set is 1. However, note guess 1 has 1 in position 2; if the secret had 1 in position 2 that would be a bull rather than a cow. So 1 must not be in position 2.\n\u2013 From guess 5 (7285) with 1 bull and 1 cow and knowing the bull comes from 8 in pos3 (since guess5 has 8 in pos3), the remaining matching digit (5) appears as a cow. In guess5, 5 is in position 4; so secret 5 must be placed elsewhere (not pos4).\n\u2013 In guess 7 (9247, 0 bulls, 1 cow) the only candidate from our set is 9, and guess7 shows 9 in position 1. This implies that secret 9 cannot be position 1.\n\u2013 Also, look at guess 4 (1478, 0 bulls, 2 cows): the intersection with our set {1,5,8,9} is {1,8} and we already have 8 in pos3. For both to be cows, 1 must not be in position 1 (since guess4 has 1 in position 1) and 8 must not be in position 4 (which is true as we fixed 8 in pos3).\n\nA natural arrangement that satisfies these constraints is:\n\u2003 Position 1: 5\n\u2003 Position 2: 9\n\u2003 Position 3: 8 (from guess 6)\n\u2003 Position 4: 1\n\nVerifying quickly:\n\u2013 Guess 1: 0123 \u2192 intersection with {5,9,8,1} is {1}. In guess 1, 1 is in pos2 while secret 1 is in pos4 \u2192 1 cow.\n\u2013 Guess 2: 4056 \u2192 intersection yields {5} (since 5 is secret and in pos1, and guess has 5 in pos3) \u2192 1 cow.\n\u2013 Guess 3: 7890 \u2192 intersection yields {8,9}. In guess 3, 8 is in pos2 and 9 is in pos3; in secret 8 is pos3 and 9 is pos2, so both are cows \u2192 2 cows.\n\u2013 Guess 4: 1478 \u2192 intersection yields {1,8}. In guess 4, 1 is pos1 and 8 is pos4; in secret, 1 is pos4 and 8 is pos3 \u2192 both cows.\n\u2013 Guess 5: 7285 \u2192 intersection yields {8,5}. Here, 8 is at pos3 (and guess has 8 in pos3, bull) and 5 is at pos1 while guess has 5 in pos4 (cow) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\u2013 Guess 6: 3687 \u2192 intersection yields {8} exactly in pos3 \u2192 1 bull.\n\u2013 Guess 7: 9247 \u2192 intersection yields {9} only; in guess 7, 9 is pos1 while secret has 9 in pos2 \u2192 result 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\nAll responses line up with secret 5981.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is:\n\nGUESS: 5981"

That means exactly two of the digits from {4, 5, 6, 2} are present in the secret number, again in different positions from those in 4562.\n\nNotice that 2 appears in both guesses. There are two possibilities at this point:\n\u2003\u2013 It might be that the one candidate from guess 1 is 2. Then in guess 2, 2 is one candidate and exactly one digit among {4, 5, 6} is the other candidate.\n\u2003\u2013 Alternatively, 2 might not be the candidate from guess 1 (so the secret digit from {0,1,2,3} would be one of 0, 1, or 3), and then the two candidates from guess 2 would both come from {4, 5, 6}.\n\nWe also know that whenever a digit is confirmed as present by being a cow, it must appear in a different position than in the guess that gave that cow result. For example, if 2 is part of the secret, it cannot be in position 3 (from guess 1) or position 4 (from guess 2).\n\nI now want to design a guess that helps distinguish between these possibilities. A good approach is to test both 1 and 2 from the first group, along with one candidate (4) from the second group and one new digit (7) to start checking the still-untested digits.\n\nWhen picking positions, it\u2019s helpful to avoid placing a digit in any position where it previously appeared; for instance, if 2 is in the secret it can\u2019t be in pos3 (from guess 1) or pos4 (from guess 2), so placing it in pos1 or pos2 is safer. Similarly, 1 appeared in pos2 of guess 1 so if it\u2019s the candidate, it can\u2019t be in pos2 again. Also, 4 came in pos1 in guess 2, so it shouldn\u2019t go in pos1.\n\nWith that in mind, I propose trying:\n\u2003Position 1: 2\u2003\u2003 (allowed \u2013 2 did not appear in pos1 before)\n\u2003Position 2: 7\u2003\u2003 (new digit, no restrictions)\n\u2003Position 3: 1\u2003\u2003 (1 did not appear in pos3 before)\n\u2003Position 4: 4\u2003\u2003 (4 did not appear in pos4 before)\n\nThis guess\u20142714\u2014will help us test whether 2 or 1 is the candidate from {0,1,2,3} and which digit from {4,5,6} (if any) is present. It also introduces a new digit (7) to check the possibility that one of the remaining secret digits might be among the untested ones.\n\nGUESS: 2714"

In that branch:\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess 0123 the cow must be 2.\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess 4562, since 2 is already present and appears there, only one more digit among {4, 5, 6} is allowed.

Thus in Case A the secret would be either {2,5,8,9} or {2,6,8,9} \u2013 and note that when 2 is in the secret, its earlier \u201cillegal\u201d positions force it to be in position 2 in the secret.\n\nThe alternative (Case B) is that 2 is not in the secret. Then the single digit from the set {0,1,2,3} (from Guess 0123) must be one of {0,1,3} and from the set {2,7,1,4} (Guess 2714) the single digit must be one of {7,1,4} while from Guess 4562 exactly two digits from {4,5,6} must be present. One illustrative possibility for Case B (one of several) would be a secret like {5,6,7} together with either 0 or 3 from the first group.\n\nThe key difference between these branches is whether 2 is in the secret. In Case A it must be and, because of previous positions (in Guess 2714 it was in position 1 and in Guess 4562 it was in position 4), in any valid secret 2 would have to be placed in position 2. In contrast, in Case B, 2 is absent.\n\nTo try to differentiate these cases, it makes sense in our next guess to place a 2 in position 2. In addition we want to check some candidate digits from the group {4,5,6} further. For instance, if we include both 5 and 6 then:\n\u2003\u2013 Under Case A (say the secret is {2,5,8,9} or {2,6,8,9}) we expect 2 to hit as a bull (since it must be in pos2) while only one of {5,6} is present.\n\u2003\u2013 Under a Case B candidate (for example, a secret like {5,6,7,0} or {5,6,7,3}) the digit 2 won\u2019t match at all, while 5 and 6 should give a stronger signal.\n\nI will therefore propose testing the digits 5, 2, 6, and a new digit 8. I will arrange them as follows:\n\u2003Position 1: 5\n\u2003Position 2: 2\u2003\u2003\u2013 Testing 2 in the \u201crequired\u201d slot if it is indeed present.\n\u2003Position 3: 6\n\u2003Position 4: 8\n\nThis guess (5268) should help us distinguish whether 2 is truly in the secret (it would then score a bull at pos2) and give additional information about the status of 5 and 6.\n\nGUESS: 5268"

Since later evidence will rule out 1, 2, and 3, it looks like 0 is the candidate from this set.\n\u2022 Guess 4562 (0 bulls, 2 cows) tells us that exactly two digits from {4, 5, 6, 2} are present. (Our later reasoning will force these two to be 4 and 5.)\n\u2022 Guess 2714 (0 bulls, 1 cow) shows that exactly one digit from {2, 7, 1, 4} is present. (Since 2 is ruled out by other clues and we already expect 0 from the first guess, that one candidate must be 4.)\n\u2022 Guess 5268 (1 bull, 0 cows) gives us a \u201cposition\u2010hit.\u201d Because the only digit of {5, 2, 6, 8} that will work with the above deductions is 5\u2014and to avoid conflicts in the other guesses, 5 must be placed where it makes a bull here.\n\nPutting these clues together, we see that the secret must contain 5 and 4 from the \u201c4562\u201d group, 0 from the \u201c0123\u201d group, and, by elimination, the remaining digit is one that hasn\u2019t appeared yet (and also must not add extra cows in earlier guesses). In fact, the only remaining candidate that doesn\u2019t conflict is 9. (For example, if 1 or 3 were used instead of 0, then guess 2714 would have shown more than one match.) \n\nSo our candidate digit set is {5, 4, 0, 9}.\n\nNow we also have some placement restrictions from the earlier guesses:\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess 5268, one bull was recorded. Since we\u2019ve concluded that 5 must be that digit, 5 must appear in the same position as in guess 5268. In guess 5268 the 5 is in position 1, so secret 5 must be in pos1.\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess 4562, 4 is in position 1, so secret 4 cannot be in pos1.\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess 2714, 4 is in position 4, so secret 4 cannot be in pos4.\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess 0123, 0 is in position 1, so secret 0 cannot be in pos1.\n\nThus, with 5 fixed in pos1, the remaining three digits {4, 0, 9} can be arranged in positions 2, 3, and 4 with the only restriction that 4 cannot be in position 4. For example, these four candidate orders are possible:\n\u2003A: 5\u20134\u20130\u20139\n\u2003B: 5\u20134\u20139\u20130\n\u2003C: 5\u20130\u20134\u20139\n\u2003D: 5\u20139\u20134\u20130\n\nAll of these produce the same earlier feedback when compared with our previous guesses.\n\nTo try to distinguish between these possibilities, I want to use all four candidate digits again but in an order that will help split the remaining possibilities. I propose the guess 5904. (In this guess, we use 5 in pos1 as required; a different permutation of 0, 9, and 4 may give different feedback patterns for the candidate orders. For instance, some candidates would yield 2 bulls and 2 cows and others 1 bull and 3 cows, which will help pinpoint the exact ordering.)\n\nI'll now make my next guess:\n\nGUESS: 5904"

In fact, for this guess to reach 1 bull, 8 should be in the right placement: pos3.\n\u2003\nSo we arrive at a candidate structure for the secret:\n\u2003Secret = [X, 1, 0, 8]\nThat is, 1 is likely in pos1, 0 in pos2, and 8 in pos3. (In guess 0123 the 0 appears at pos0 and 1 at pos1; for our feedback to be 1 bull and 1 cow, one of these must be correctly placed and the other misplaced. With our candidate, 1 in pos1 would be a bull if that were the case, and 0 would then have to come from a different position than pos0 \u2013 it fits by being in pos2.)\n\u2003\nThe remaining unknown digit X in pos0 must be chosen from digits not already used and not among the ruled\u2010out ones (2,3 if 3 would add a third from guess 0123, 7,4). A natural possibility is that X is either 6 or 9 (or another digit not interfering with our previous results). Both 6108 and 9108 would satisfy the earlier feedback.\n\u2003\nTo distinguish between these possibilities we can now test, for example, 9108. If 9108 yields 4 bulls then the secret is 9108. Otherwise, a result like 3 bulls, 0 cows (with one digit off) would indicate that X should be 6.\n\u2003\nThus, my next guess will be 9108.\n\nGUESS: 9108"

That indicates that three digits are exactly correct while one digit is wrong. Since our structure from earlier strongly indicated that 1, 0, and 8 are in the secret at positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively, the only suspect is the first digit: 9. Since 9 produced a bull previously if it were correct, but now we have a discrepancy, it must be that the correct digit in position 0 is different from 9.

The common digit 0 might be the candidate from the first guess. In that case, 0 is in the secret and its cow in 0123 tells us it is not in position 1 (and from 4560, it can\u2019t be in position 4). Also, because exactly 2 of the digits in 4560 are in the secret and 0 counts as one of them, only one of {4, 5, 6} is present.\n2. Alternatively, 0 might not be in the secret. Then the cow from 0123 comes from one of {1, 2, 3} (so one of those is in the secret) and, because 0 is absent, exactly 2 of {4, 5, 6} must be present from the feedback on 4560.\n\nTo help distinguish these cases, it\u2019s wise to design a guess that tests one candidate from the 0123 group (say, 1) and one candidate from the 4560 group (for example, 4) while also considering the positional restrictions we already have. (Recall, from 0123 the digit 1 was in position 2, so if 1 is indeed in the secret it cannot be in that same position; and from 4560, if 4 is in the secret it cannot be in position 1.) \n\nWith that in mind, I propose the guess 1047:\n\u2022 It includes 1 (testing the possibility from {1,2,3}),\n\u2022 It includes 0 (checking the potential common digit),\n\u2022 It includes 4 (from the {4,5,6} group), and\n\u2022 It adds 7 as a new digit to probe outside our current suspects.\n\nIn 1047, note that 0 is placed in position 2 (allowed since if 0 is secret, it cannot be in position 1 or 4), and 1 is in position 1 (allowed since in 0123, 1 was in position 2). This guess should help us begin to tell apart whether 0 belongs in the secret and whether the digit from {1,2,3} is 1, as well as further testing the candidate from {4,5,6}.\n\nGUESS: 1047"

This creates two scenarios:\n\u2003Scenario 1: 0 is in the secret.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then from 0123 the one candidate is 0 (which cannot be in position 1 as in guess 0123).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 And from 4560, with 0 already included, only one of {4, 5, 6} is in the secret.\n\u2003Scenario 2: 0 is not in the secret.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then the cow in 0123 must come from one of {1, 2, 3}.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 And from 4560, both cows must be from {4, 5, 6}.\n\nOur third guess (1047 with 0 bulls, 2 cows) gave us additional hints. In 1047 the digits 1, 0, 4, 7 are used. Notice that if 0 is in the secret (Scenario 1) then none of {1, 7} should count from the first guess and only one of {4, 5, 6} (here 4) is in; whereas if 0 is absent (Scenario 2) then the candidate from {1, 2, 3} could be 1 and two digits from {4, 5, 6} (here potentially 4 and another) are in.\n\nTo distinguish these scenarios, the next guess should force a difference in the outcome based on whether 0 is present and whether 1 is in or not\u2014and also test the presence of digits from {4, 5, 6}. I propose to include:\n\u2003\u2022 0 in the guess so that if Scenario 1 holds, we get a cow for 0, and if 0 is absent (Scenario 2) we get no contribution from it.\n\u2003\u2022 1 from {1, 2, 3} to test that possibility.\n\u2003\u2022 Two digits from {4, 5, 6} (here 5 and 4) so that in Scenario 2 (with 0 absent) we expect both to be cows while in Scenario 1 only one from {4, 5, 6} is in the secret.\nBy arranging these digits in new positions (avoiding positions that were previously used for those candidates when they gave cows), we can force a different feedback.\n\nI propose the guess \"5014\":\n\u2003Position 1: 5 \u2013 (in guess 4560, 5 was in position 2; new position here)\n\u2003Position 2: 0 \u2013 (in previous guesses, 0 was in pos1, pos4, and pos2 already appeared in guess 1047 so if 0 is in secret it must not be in pos2; however we know from guess 1047\u2019s 0 bulls that if 0 is indeed in the secret it cannot be in pos2 \u2013 so if we see a cow here it confirms its presence in another position)\n\u2003Position 3: 1 \u2013 (shifts 1 to a new position; note 1 was in positions 2 and 1 before)\n\u2003Position 4: 4 \u2013 (finally shifting 4 to a new position compared to its previous placements)\n\nUnder Scenario 1 (secret contains 0 and exactly one digit from {4,5,6}), we\u2019d expect only 2 of the guess\u2019s digits (namely the 0 and the one candidate among 4 or 5) to contribute as cows.\nUnder Scenario 2 (secret does not contain 0 but contains a digit from {1,2,3} \u2013 here 1 \u2013 plus two from {4,5,6}), we\u2019d expect 3 cows (from 5, 1, and 4) if their positions are all mismatched.\n\nThus, the feedback from \"5014\" should help us decide which scenario is likely and guide further narrowing-down of the secret.\n\nGUESS: 5014"

Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve deduced so far without 0 in the secret:\n\n\u2022 From 0123 (0 bulls, 1 cow): exactly one digit among {0,1,2,3} is present. Since 0 is dropped now, the secret must contain exactly one of {1,2,3}.\n\u2022 From 4560 (0 bulls, 2 cows): exactly two digits among {4,5,6,0} are present. With 0 ruled out, the secret must contain exactly two digits from {4,5,6}.\n\u2022 From 1047 (0 bulls, 2 cows): exactly two digits among {1,0,4,7} are in the secret. With 0 gone, this means two among {1,4,7} appear.\n\u2022 From 5014 (0 bulls, 1 cow): exactly one digit among {5,0,1,4} appears. Again, with 0 eliminated, exactly one of {5,1,4} is present.\n\nThese clues force 1 not to be the candidate (because if 1 were in the secret, then guess 5014 would have two common among {1,4}\u2014but it only gave one cow). In effect, we then have:\n\u2003\u2013 Exactly one from {1,2,3} is in the secret, and it can\u2019t be 1. So it\u2019s either 2 or 3.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 4560 tells us that two from {4,5,6} are in the secret. In guess 5014, since only 4 (from {5,1,4}) can appear, that forces 5 to be absent and hence the two must be 4 and 6.\n\u2003\u2013 Finally, from 1047 (using {1,4,7}) and already having 4 confirmed, we must have 7.\n\nSo the secret\u2019s digits are 4,6,7 and one of {2,3}.\n\nWe also know from previous position feedback that:\n\u2003\u2022 In guess 4560 (with 4 in pos1 and 6 in pos3) neither digit was in its actual position;\n\u2003\u2022 In guess 1047, 4 (in pos3) and 7 (in pos4) were misplaced;\n\u2003\u2022 In guess 5014, 4 (in pos4) was misplaced.\n\nThat forces 4 to be in a position other than 1, 3, or 4 \u2013 so 4 must be in position 2 in the secret.\n\nA good next guess is to try an arrangement of the four digits {4,6,7} along with our remaining candidate (2 or 3) so that\u2014depending on whether the secret contains 2 or 3\u2014the feedback will differ. For example, consider the guess 7462. (If the secret actually contains 2 then its digits will be {2,4,6,7}; if instead it holds 3 then the set is {3,4,6,7}.) In one case the feedback will be different from the other, and that difference will point us to which candidate from {2,3} is correct.\n\nLet\u2019s illustrate with possible secret orders that satisfy the earlier restrictions:\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret is {2,4,6,7} (for instance 6,4,7,2), then comparing with guess 7462:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 1: 7 (secret has 7 in pos3) \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 2: 4 (secret has 4 in pos2) \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 3: 6 (secret has 6 in pos1) \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 4: 2 (secret has 2 in pos4) \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003Result: 2 bulls and 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret is {3,4,6,7} (say, 3,4,7,6), then with guess 7462:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 1: 7 (secret has 7 in pos3) \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 2: 4 (secret has 4 in pos2) \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 3: 6 (secret has 6 in pos4) \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 4: 2 is not present.\n\u2003\u2003Result: 1 bull and 2 cows.\n\nThus, the feedback from 7462 will help us decide if the additional digit is 2 or 3 and begin to nail down the secret\u2019s ordering.\n\nGUESS: 7462"

Rather than assuming a candidate from {1,2,3} or from {4,5,6}, the results from our guesses can be explained if the secret actually contains 0\u2014making the one common digit from 0123 the 0 rather than a 1, 2, or 3. Then the responses become consistent if the secret\u2019s digits are drawn from {0,6,7} plus one extra digit that has not yet been tested among the lower candidates (since 4, 5, 1, 2, or 3 would have contributed extra cows in later guesses). In fact, reconciling all earlier feedback suggests a likely secret set of digits is {0,6,7,X} with X being a digit we haven\u2019t seen in previous \u201chit\u201d feedback\u2014in our testing the remaining possibility is X = 8 or 9.\n\nWorking back through the responses:\n\u2003\u2022 In 0123 the single cow can come from 0.\n\u2003\u2022 In 4560 the two cows come from 6 and 0.\n\u2003\u2022 In 1047 the two cows come from 0 and 7.\n\u2003\u2022 In 5014 the only cow is 0.\n\u2003\u2022 In 7462 the common digits are among {7,6} (since neither 4 nor 2 appear in our candidate set); receiving 1 bull and 1 cow is perfectly explained if, for example, 7 is positioned in the same place as in 7462 (making a bull) while 6 shows up in a different position (a cow).\n\nOne ordering that satisfies these conditions is if the secret\u2019s digits (in order) are 7,6,0,X with X being either 8 or 9. (Notice the following restrictions: Since 0 appeared in different positions when it was guessed we conclude 0 cannot be in a guess position in which it produced a bull\u2014in particular, in guess 5014 the 0 was in position 2 and produced a cow, so in the secret 0 must be elsewhere; similarly the guess 4560 puts 0 last, and that produced a cow, so 0 shouldn\u2019t be last. This forces 0 into position 3. Then to explain guess 7462, if we set secret position 1 to 7 then in guess 7462 the 7 in pos1 is a bull; the digit 6 (which cannot be in pos3) must then be in position 2 and appears in 7462 only in pos3 so it scores as a cow.)\n\nAt this point our secret candidate is 7,6,0,X with X either 8 or 9. A smart test is to try the ordering 7 6 0 8. If 7608 is correct then we\u2019d get 4 bulls. If instead the unknown digit is 9 (i.e. secret 7609) then our guess 7608 would get 3 bulls (positions 1,2,3 match) and show that the last digit is off.\n\nThus, my next guess will be 7608.\n\nGUESS: 7608"

One possibility is that the bull from 1234 was indeed the 1 in the first position. In that case the secret starts with 1 and none of the other digits 2, 3, or 4 appear anywhere; then in the guess 1567, the bull from the first digit (1) is counted and exactly one of the other digits (5, 6, or 7, in its same position as in our guess) is a bull while the other two do not appear in the secret.\n\nAnother possibility is that the bull from 1234 was not the 1. For example, it could be the 3 in the third position (if that were the case, then 1, 2, and 4 would not appear in the secret). Then the secret would have its third digit as 3. In the guess 1567 this would mean the bull(s) come from positions other than the first if the secret does not have 1 at position 1.

If the secret truly begins with 1 (first possibility), then changing the first digit should drop our bull count; if the secret does not begin with 1 (as in the second possibility) and instead has fixed digits in positions 2, 3, and 4, then keeping those positions (5, 3, and 7 respectively) should give us many bulls.\n\nI will now try a guess that replaces the first digit (from 1 to a new digit, 8) but leaves positions 2, 3, and 4 as 5, 3, and 7. \n\nConsider:\n\u2022 If the secret starts with 1 (possibility one) then \u201c8537\u201d loses the bull in position 1 (and based on which of 5, 6, or 7 was the other bull earlier, we might get 0 or 1 bull now).\n\u2022 But if the secret\u2019s confirmed digits (from the second possibility) are in pos2, pos3, and pos4 (namely 5, 3, and 7), then \u201c8537\u201d would match these positions and produce 3 bulls.\n\nThus the outcome of \u201c8537\u201d will help us decide which possibility applies.\n\nGUESS: 8537"

That implies exactly one of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 is in the secret number in the same position as our guess and the other three aren\u2019t present at all. In our second guess (1567) we got 2 bulls and 0 cows. Because we kept the 1 in the first position, a natural way to reconcile these outcomes is to suppose that the bull from the first guess was from digit 1 (in position 1) and that in the second guess the other bull comes from one of the digits 5, 6, or 7. However, our third guess (8537) gave 0 bulls and 1 cow. That result rules out having 5 or 7 in that same position because if 5 or 7 were the additional bull from guess 2 then they would show up as bulls again in guess 3. Instead, the only consistent scenario is that digit 6 is the bull from guess 2. In other words, we now deduce the secret\u2019s first digit is 1 and its third digit is 6. (Also, from guess 1 we know that if 1 is the bull then 2, 3, and 4 do not appear anywhere, and from guess 2 the other digits 5 and 7 must be absent.) \n\nThen looking at guess 3 (8537), none of its digits appear in the correct position. Yet we received 1 cow. Given that 5, 7, and 3 are eliminated, the only candidate from that guess is 8. So the secret must include an 8 but not in the same position as guess 3\u2019s placement. Since guess 3 had 8 in position 1 but we\u2019re confident the secret has 1 there, the digit 8 must appear in one of the other positions (either position 2 or 4).\n\nSo at this point, the secret must be of the form \n\u2003\u20031 ? 6 ? \nwith the unknown two digits coming from {0, 8, 9} (since 2,3,4,5,7 are ruled out) and one of these unknowns must be 8.\n\nA good strategy now is to test one specific candidate arrangement to narrow down the possibilities. I propose the next guess be 1869. This guess keeps the deduced digits 1 and 6 in positions 1 and 3, places 8 in position 2 (to see if that is correct), and uses 9 in position 4 (as a candidate from the remaining pool). Based on the actual secret, this guess will let us tell whether 8 belongs in position 2 or (otherwise) in position 4, and whether 9 appears in the secret.\n\nGUESS: 1869"

Since we kept the 1 in the first position, it\u2019s natural to think that 1 in position 1 is the bull from guess 1 and that among 5, 6, 7 one digit (which later turns out to be 6) is the other bull.\n\u2022 Guess 3 (8537) produced 0 bulls, 1 cow. Given our elimination of 5, 7, and 3 (from earlier deductions if 1 is the bull in guess 1), the only candidate is 8. And since position 1 in guess 3 had 8, and we already believe that the secret starts with 1, the 8 must be elsewhere \u2013 either in position 2 or 4.\n\u2022 Guess 4 (1869) resulted in 3 bulls, 0 cows. Our proposal was 1869 (with 1, 8, 6 in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively) and a candidate 9 in position 4. With 3 bulls, it means three positions match the secret exactly while one does not. We already expect positions 1 and 3 (with 1 and 6) to be correct. Hence either:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 2 is correct (i.e. the secret has 8 there) and position 4 is incorrect, or\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 4 is correct and position 2 is not.\n\u2022 However, because guess 3 showed that 8 is in the secret but not in its guess position (which was position 1), and since we already have a 1 in position 1, 8 must be in one of positions 2 or 4. The only way to reconcile all data is for the secret to have 8 in position 2. (Also recall 9 was never indicated to be in the secret previously.) \n\nThis leads us to a secret of the form:\n\u2003\u2003Position 1: 1\n\u2003\u2003Position 2: 8\n\u2003\u2003Position 3: 6\n\u2003\u2003Position 4: unknown\n\nNow, which digit is left for position 4? From our previous eliminations we ruled out 2,3,4 (from guess 1); 5,7 (from guess 2), and 9 (since guess 4\u2019s bull count indicates it was wrong there). That leaves 0 as a viable candidate. Let\u2019s test that hypothesis: \n\u2003\u2003Secret = 1-8-6-0\n\nTesting against all guesses:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1234 vs 1860: Only position 1 (1) matches \u2192 1 bull, 0 cows.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1567 vs 1860: Positions 1 (1) and 3 (6) match \u2192 2 bulls, 0 cows.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 8537 vs 1860: 8 is in the secret (position 2) but guessed in pos1 \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1869 vs 1860: Positions 1 (1), 2 (8) and 3 (6) match, while position 4 (9 vs 0) is off \u2192 3 bulls, 0 cows.\nEverything fits perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the secret must be 1860.\n\nGUESS: 1860"

This tells us exactly one digit among {0, 1, 2, 3} is in the secret number (and in a different position). Then our second guess 4078 gave 0 bulls and 2 cows. Its digits {4, 0, 7, 8} contain exactly two of the secret\u2019s digits\u2014but note 0 appears in both guesses. That means there are two scenarios to consider:\n\n\u2022 Scenario A: The secret\u2019s one digit from {0, 1, 2, 3} is 0. In that case, 0 is \u201ccounted\u201d in both the first and second guess. For 4078 to yield 2 cows then the other secret digit from that set must come from {4, 7, 8} (only one more from that set, since 0 is already chosen). With 0 and one digit from {4,7,8} identified by these conditions, the remaining 2 digits (since the secret has 4 digits) must come from outside the combined set {0,1,2,3,4,7,8}\u2014that is, from {5,6,9}.\n\n\u2022 Scenario B: The secret\u2019s digit from {0, 1, 2, 3} is not 0 but one of {1, 2, 3}. Then 0 is not present in the secret. For our 4078 guess to have exactly 2 cows, both \u201ccows\u201d must come from {4,7,8} (because 0 is absent). In that case the secret has one digit from {1,2,3}, two digits from {4,7,8} and the remaining digit must come from the other digits (again, from {5,6,9} as those lie outside the union {0,1,2,3,4,7,8}).\n\nThe key difference between the two scenarios is whether 0 is in the secret or not. I want to design a next guess that will help clearly differentiate this. Observe that if we try a guess whose digits come from the set {0,5,6,9} then:\n\n\u2013 In Scenario A (if 0 is in and secret\u2019s two \u201cother\u201d digits are chosen from {5,6,9}), the secret will contain 0 plus 2 digits from {5,6,9}. Our guess has 0 and all three digits from {5,6,9} (i.e. 5, 6, and 9). The intersection with the secret will then be 0 and, exactly, the two that the secret actually chose from {5,6,9}. That gives 3 matching digits.\n  \n\u2013 In Scenario B (if 0 is not in the secret, and only one digit is in {5,6,9}), then our guess from {0,5,6,9} will hit only that one digit (since 0 is absent). That yields exactly 1 match.\n\nThus, by choosing a guess that uses only digits from {0,5,6,9}, we expect a dramatically different response:\n\u2022 A reply of 3 cows (or bulls+cows, depending on positions) would support Scenario A.\n\u2022 A reply of 1 (or low count) would support Scenario B.\n\nWith that in mind, my next guess will be 0569.\n\nGUESS: 0569"

In addition, because our later results (especially from guess 0569) point to 0 not being in the number, this one digit must be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n\u2022 In the second guess (4078, 0 bulls and 2 cows), since 0 is now ruled out, both cows must come from {4, 7, 8}. So the secret includes exactly two digits chosen from 4, 7, and 8 (with each digit not occupying the same position as in 4078).\n\n\u2022 In the third guess (0569, 1 bull and 0 cows), among the digits {0, 5, 6, 9} we got exactly one bull and no other appearances. With 0 already excluded, the only digit present belongs to {5, 6, 9} and is correctly placed in this guess. In other words, exactly one digit from {5, 6, 9} is in the secret and it appears in the same position as in 0569.\n\nThus the secret number\u2019s digits come from three groups:\n\u2003\u2013 One digit from {1, 2, 3}.\n\u2003\u2013 Two digits from {4, 7, 8}.\n\u2003\u2013 One digit from {5, 6, 9}.\n\nThe next guess should test specific candidates from these groups while respecting known positional restrictions:\n\u2003\u2022 If we choose from {1,2,3}, note that in guess 0123 the digit (say 1 if we choose it) was in position 2; so we shouldn\u2019t place it there.\n\u2003\u2022 From {4,7,8}, in guess 4078 the digits 4, 7, and 8 were in positions 1, 3, and 4 respectively.

That digit, whichever it is, is in its correct position there. To test a possibility, we can \u201cassign\u201d one candidate to the corresponding position.\n\nA promising next guess is to try one candidate from each group. For example, let\u2019s try:\n\u2003\u2022 From {1,2,3} choose 1. We can place 1 in position 1 (it wasn\u2019t in position 1 in 0123).\n\u2003\u2022 From {4,7,8} choose 4 and 8. In guess 4078, 4 was in position 1 (so we avoid that) and 8 was in position 4 (so we avoid that). We can place 4 in position 2 and 8 in position 3.\n\u2003\u2022 From {5,6,9} choose 9. In guess 0569, 9 was in position 4 (and if 9 is the bull from that guess, then the secret has 9 in position 4).

In our first guess (1234) we got 0 bulls and 1 cow, so exactly one digit among 1, 2, 3, or 4 is in the secret number\u2014but not in the same position. In our second guess (0516) we got 1 bull and 1 cow. Since 1 appears in both the first and second guesses, it\u2019s a strong candidate for a digit in the secret. In our third guess (7610) we got 0 bulls and 2 cows from the digits 7, 6, 1, and 0. Notice that in guess three the digit 1 was placed in position 3. If 1 were correctly placed in position 3, we would have gotten a bull in guess three. Therefore, 1 must be in the secret but not in position 1 (guess one) or position 3 (guess three). Furthermore, the responses in guess two and guess three imply that from the overlapping set of digits (0,5,1,6) and (7,6,1,0) only 1 and 6 are the actual secret digits among these; the other digits (0,5,7) do not appear in the secret number.\n\nThus, we have:\n\u2013 From guess one, one digit from {1,2,3,4} is in the secret. We deduce that that digit is 1.\n\u2013 From guess two and guess three, the additional digit from that set is 6.\n\nMoreover, in guess two (0516) we got 1 bull and 1 cow. If we assume that 6 in position 4 is the bull (meaning the secret\u2019s fourth digit is 6) then 1, which appears in position 3 in guess two, must be a cow. That tells us that 1 is in the secret, but not in position 3. In guess one, the digit 1 is in position 1 and we got a cow, so 1 can\u2019t be in position 1 either. So 1 must be in position 2 (or position 4, but 6 is there by assumption).\n\nNow, from guess three (7610) with 0 bulls and 2 cows, note that neither 1 nor 6 appeared in the positions we guessed (1 in pos3 and 6 in pos2). That confirms that secret 1 is not in position 3 and secret 6 is not in position 2. With the assumption from guess two that 6 is in position 4 and 1 in position 2, our deductions hold:\n\u2003Secret pattern so far: _ 1 _ 6\n\nNow, look at the digits that have appeared in our guesses. Aside from 1 and 6, the other digits (2,3,4,0,5,7) have been shown not to be in the number (since guess one only had a single match which we already account for with the digit 1, and guess two and three provided evidence for 6 from their responses).\n\nThat leaves us with two remaining digits from 8 and 9 to fill the remaining positions (positions 1 and 3). Since both 8 and 9 have not appeared yet, the only possible combinations for the secret are:\n\u2003Option A: 8 1 9 6\n\u2003Option B: 9 1 8 6\n\nWe need another guess to determine the correct ordering of these two unknown digits. I propose guessing 8196. If the secret is 8196, you\u2019d receive 4 bulls. If the secret is 9186, this guess will yield 2 bulls and 2 cows (with 8 and 9 matching but swapped positions). That response will tell us exactly which possibility is the secret.\n\nGUESS: 8196"

That means exactly two of those digits occur in the secret number \u2013 and if they do, they\u2019re in the same position as in guess 4 \u2013 while the other two digits aren\u2019t present at all.\n\u2022 One plausible scenario is that the secret has 8 in the 1st position and 6 in the 4th position (so a = 8 and d = 6 are bulls), with 1 and 9 absent. (Other distributions are possible, but let\u2019s check this one against the earlier feedback.)\n\u2022 Then the secret takes the form 8, b, c, 6.\n\u2003\u2013 Look at Guess 1 (1234, 0 bulls, 1 cow). Its digits are {1,2,3,4}. Since 1 is not in the secret (by our assumption) the only possible match must come from b or c if either is 2, 3, or 4. But if one of b or c were among 2,3,4, that would be our one common digit.\n\u2022 Next, examine Guess 2 (0516, 1 bull, 1 cow). Its digits are {0,5,1,6}. Our secret already contains 6 (in position 4). To get exactly two matches, exactly one of the other three (0,5,1) must be present. (Since we assumed 1 is absent from the secret, that leaves 0 or 5.)\n\u2022 Then consider Guess 3 (7610, 0 bulls, 2 cows). Its digits are {7,6,1,0}. We already have 6 in our secret. That means exactly one more from {7,1,0} must appear in the secret. We already assumed 1 isn\u2019t in the secret, so that forces the extra digit to be 0.\n\u2022 Now we have deduced that the secret (of the form 8, b, c, 6) must include 0 from guesses 2 and 3. And from Guess 2, with 6 and 0 present that gives our 2-digit match. Also, in Guess 1, the secret must have exactly one digit from {1,2,3,4}. \n\u2003Since we already have 8,0,6 fixed, we need to choose b or c to supply that digit (from {2,3,4}). Also, the two unknown positions b and c are not (for Guess 4) allowed to be 1 or 9 (so that Guess 4 yields exactly 2 bulls from positions 1 and 4). And they must not \u201caccidentally\u201d produce additional matches in Guesses 2 and 3.\nLet\u2019s say we set b = 0? But we already used 0. So we must assign the 0 to one of the positions b or c. For Guess 4, positions 2 and 3 (which are b and c) must not equal 1 or 9 because that would add bulls from guess 4. \n\nOne consistent choice is to let the secret be:\n\u2003 Position 1: 8 (bull from guess 4)\n\u2003 Position 2: 0\u2003\u2003\u2003(from our deduction from Guess 2 and 3)\n\u2003 Position 3: a digit from {2,3,4}\u2003 (this will be the one digit from Guess 1\u2019s set)\n\u2003 Position 4: 6 (bull from guess 4)\n\nTest this candidate:\n\u2013 Suppose we pick 2 for position 3.

From guess 4 (8196 \u2192 2 bulls, 0 cows) we strongly suspect that 8 and 6 are correctly placed (positions 1 and 4), since that guess showed two exact matches and the remaining two digits (1 and 9) don\u2019t appear in the secret.\n\n2. Guess 5 (8026 \u2192 2 bulls, 1 cow) reinforces that idea because the bulls likely come from the matching 8 (position 1) and 6 (position 4). Between the other two digits (0 and 2) in that guess, one appears in the secret in a different position. Since having a 2 in the secret would conflict with other feedback (especially from guess 1, where exactly one digit in {1,2,3,4} is allowed) it makes sense that 0 is in the secret. However, note that in guess 5 the 0 is in position 2, so for it to register as a cow it must appear in a different position in the secret. A natural place for 0 is position 3.\n\n3. So far, we now have:\n\u2003 \u2022 Position 1: 8\n\u2003 \u2022 Position 3: 0\n\u2003 \u2022 Position 4: 6\n\n4. Guess 1 (1234 \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow) tells us that exactly one digit among {1,2,3,4} is in the secret \u2013 and it must lie in a position different from its guess position. Since 8,0,6 are already allocated, the remaining digit (let\u2019s call it X) must come from {1,2,3,4}. However, our earlier guesses rule out 1 and 2 (if 1 were present, guess 4 or guess 2 would have produced extra cows/bulls). This leaves X as either 3 or 4. Moreover, in guess 1 the digit from {1,2,3,4} appears as a cow. Since the guess \u201c1234\u201d has 3 in position3 and 4 in position4, and our secret already has digits fixed at those positions (0 and 6, respectively), X must avoid those same positions. With positions 1,3,4 occupied by 8,0,6, the only remaining slot is position 2.\n\n5. Thus our two candidates for the secret are:\n\u2003 Option A: 8, 3, 0, 6\n\u2003 Option B: 8, 4, 0, 6\n\n6. We need a guess that will distinguish between these two possibilities. I propose guessing 8306:\n\u2003 \u2022 If the secret is 8,3,0,6, then guessing 8306 will yield 4 bulls.\n\u2003 \u2022 If the secret is 8,4,0,6, then guessing 8306 will yield 3 bulls (with a mismatch in the second digit), so we will get 3 bulls and 0 cows.\n\nThis guess will allow us to determine exactly which candidate is the secret.\n\nGUESS: 8306"

Notice here that the only digits common to both guesses are 1 and 2. If, for instance, the answer had included one of the other digits (3, 4, 5, or 6), then the counts would likely have differed between the two guesses. The most consistent explanation is that the two correct digits from 1234 are 1 and 2, and these are also the two contributing cows in 2156.\n\n\u2022 Since in 1234 the digit 1 was guessed in position 1 and digit 2 in position 2 (both were cows), they cannot occupy those positions in the secret number. Similarly, in 2156 the digit 2 is in position 1 and 1 in position 2, ruling out those positions as well for these digits.

Let\u2019s summarize what we know so far:\n\n\u2022 Guess 1 (1234) produced 0 bulls and 2 cows. This tells us exactly two of the four digits 1, 2, 3, 4 appear somewhere in the secret number\u2014but not in the positions we tried in 1234.\n\n\u2022 Guess 2 (2156) also gave 0 bulls and 2 cows. In comparing 1234 and 2156 the only digits common to both guesses are 1 and 2. (Any other pairing from 1234 would not appear twice in a way that gives two cows in guess\u00a02.) At first glance this would suggest that both 1 and 2 belong. However, with that assumption the intersection of the secret number with guess 3 (7812) would be at least the two digits 1 and 2. Yet guess 3 reported only 1 bull and 0 cows. \n\n\u2022 In the Bulls and Cows system a result of \u201c1 bull, 0 cows\u201d means exactly one digit from the guess is present in the secret number and it is in the correct position. The other three digits do not appear anywhere in the secret. Therefore, from guess 3 (7 8 1 2) only one of these four digits belongs; the other three definitely do not. If we required both 1 and 2 to be in the secret (as one might infer from guesses 1 and 2) then the intersection with {7,8,1,2} would have size 2, not 1.\n\nThis forces us to reconcile the three responses by concluding that although the identical candidates in guesses 1 and 2 were \u201c1 and 2\u201d to supply the two cows there, only one of these can actually be in the secret; the other two \u201ccows\u201d from guess\u00a01 must come from the remaining pair among 3 and 4. Similarly, in guess 2 the two cows must come from 1 (or 2) plus a digit from 5 or 6. In other words, a consistent possibility is that the secret contains exactly one digit from {1,2} plus one digit from {3,4} (to account for guess\u00a01) and exactly one digit from {1,2} (the same one as before) plus one from {5,6} (for guess\u00a02). Then guess 3 (7 8 1 2) tells us that among the two candidates from {1,2} only one appears in the secret\u2014and it is correctly placed in guess\u00a03. (Also, none of 7 or 8 is in the secret.)\n\nA candidate fitting this scenario is as follows. Suppose the secret does include 1 rather than 2. Then:\n\n\u2013 From guess 1 the other matching digit must be chosen from {3,4}; for instance, 3.\n\u2013 From guess 2 the second matching digit (aside from 1) must come from {5,6}; say 5.\n\u2013 The fourth digit (which we have not yet seen in any guess) we can choose from among those not eliminated (not 2,7,8, or any digit whose inclusion would push the intersections over the reported counts). One consistent choice is 9.\n\nFurthermore, guess 3 gave \u201c1 bull, 0 cows\u201d and its third digit is 1. To have that 1 count as a bull (and not a cow) we must place the digit 1 in the secret number exactly in position 3.\n\nOne arrangement of the candidate set {3,5,1,9} that meets the conditions is:\n\u2003\u2003Position 1: 3\n\u2003\u2003Position 2: 5\n\u2003\u2003Position 3: 1\n\u2003\u2003Position 4: 9\n\nLet\u2019s quickly check this candidate against the responses:\n\n\u2022 For guess 1 (1234): The secret (3,5,1,9) shares digits 1 and 3 with 1234. In guess 1 the 1 is at position 1 and 3 is at position 3. In our secret, 1 is in position 3 (so 1 is a cow, not a bull) and 3 is in position 1 (again a cow). That gives 0 bulls and 2 cows.\n\u2022 For guess 2 (2156): The secret shares digits 1 and 5 with 2156. In guess 2, 1 is in position 2 and 5 in position 3. In our secret, 1 is in position 3 and 5 is in position 2, so both are cows (0 bulls, 2 cows).\n\u2022 For guess 3 (7812): The secret shares only the digit 1. And since 1 is at position 3 in both guess and secret, that is 1 bull and no other common digits appear \u2014 matching 1 bull, 0 cows.\n\nThis candidate is entirely consistent with all clues. Therefore, testing the possibility by guessing 3519 next will help us further narrow things down.\n\nGUESS: 3519"

That means exactly one digit from {7, 8, 1, 2} is present\u2014and it is in the correct position.\n  \n\u2022 Guess 4 (3519) produced 2 bulls and 0 cows. Therefore, exactly 2 of the digits in positions (1)3, (2)5, (3)1, (4)9 are in the secret, and they are exactly in those positions; the other two digits are not present at all.\n\nA consistent scenario emerges if we suppose that the digit 1 is the single digit from {7,8,1,2} (making it the bull in guess 3) and it is in position 3 (since guess 3 is 7,8,1,2, with the \u201c1\u201d in the third slot). Then the two correct digits from guess 1 (which gave 2 cows) could be 3 and 1. That is, secret contains 3 and 1\u2014but in 1234, 1 was in pos1 and 3 in pos3, so in the secret 1 cannot be in pos1 or 3, and 3 cannot be in pos3 or pos? However, if we already place 1 in pos3 based on guess 3, then 3 must appear in a different position (and it must come from guess 1\u2019s pool, {1,2,3,4}).  \n\nLooking at guess 2, with digits {2,1,5,6} and a result of 0 bulls and 2 cows, we already have 1 (which we propose is in pos3 of the secret) acting as one match. The other match in guess 2 must then be among {5,6} (since it isn\u2019t 2 if we\u2019re keeping the single intersection from {7, 8, 1,2} solely as 1). So far, that suggests the secret has 1, one digit from {3,4} (to cover guess 1\u2019s two cows with 1 already chosen, 3 is a possibility) and one digit from {5,6}.\n\nNow, guess 4 (3519) tells us that exactly 2 digits among {3,5,1,9} are in the secret and exactly placed. If we suppose the two bulls come from positions 1 and 3 of guess 4\u2014that is, position1 = 3 and position3 = 1\u2014then we get:\n\u2003Secret pos1 = 3\n\u2003Secret pos3 = 1\n\nSince guess 4\u2019s response is 2 bulls and 0 cows, the other two digits in guess 4, namely 5 and 9 (in positions 2 and 4), cannot be in the secret.\n  \nReturning to guess 2, we needed a match among {2,1,5,6} aside from 1. We cannot use 5 (it\u2019s now ruled out) and 2 is in {7,8,1,2} which already provided the one bull (1). So that leaves 6 as the candidate from the set {5,6}. Therefore, secret must include 6.\n  \nNow the secret already has 2 confirmed digits (3 in pos1 and 1 in pos3) and the 6 from guess 2. That makes 3 digits. We still need a fourth digit. Revisit guess 1: the secret must intersect {1,2,3,4} in exactly 2 digits. Our secret already has 3 and 1, so it cannot have any extra digit from {2,4}. Similarly, guess 2\u2019s intersection with {2,1,5,6} is exactly {1,6} (we already have those), so the fourth digit must not be 2, 5, or any digit that would increase intersections with those sets. Also, guess 3 forces the intersection with {7,8,1,2} to be exactly 1 digit (which is our 1), so the fourth digit cannot be 7, 8, or 2. And guess 4 shows no further digits from {3,5,1,9}, so the fourth digit must not be 5 or 9. A natural candidate that does not conflict with any of these restrictions is 0.\n  \nThus, one candidate for the secret is:\n\u2003Position 1: 3\n\u2003Position 2: 6\n\u2003Position 3: 1\n\u2003Position 4: 0\n\nLet\u2019s quickly check:\n\u2003Guess 1 (1234): Intersection with {3,6,1,0} is {1,3}. In 1234, 1 is pos1 and 3 is pos3; in the secret, 1 is pos3 and 3 is pos1, so both count as cows \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2003Guess 2 (2156): Intersection with {3,6,1,0} is {1,6}. In guess 2, 1 is pos2 and 6 is pos4; in secret, 1 is pos3 and 6 is pos2 \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2003Guess 3 (7812): Intersection with {3,6,1,0} is {1}. And in guess 3, 1 is pos3 which matches secret pos3 \u2192 1 bull, 0 cows.\n\u2003Guess 4 (3519): Intersection with {3,6,1,0} is {3,1} exactly in positions 1 and 3 \u2192 2 bulls, 0 cows.\n\nAll responses match perfectly. Therefore, it\u2019s time to guess the candidate 3610.\n\nGUESS: 3610"

So exactly two of the digits from {2,1,5,6} are present, each in a different position from where they were in 2156.\n\n\u2022 Guess 3 (7812) produced 1 bull and 0 cows. This means that of the digits {7,8,1,2} only one digit is in the secret number and it is placed exactly as in the guess. The other three do not appear at all.\n\n\u2022 Guess 4 (3519) produced 2 bulls and 0 cows. This tells us that exactly two of the digits {3,5,1,9} are in the secret number and in the exact positions they appear in this guess; the other two don\u2019t appear anywhere in the secret.\n\n\u2022 Guess 5 (3610) produced 1 bull and 1 cow, so exactly two digits among {3,6,1,0} are in the secret, with one at the correct position and the other in a different position.\n\nA promising approach is to first decide which candidate digit is the one from Guess 3\u2019s set {7,8,1,2}. One natural option is to take the bull from Guess 3 as the digit in position 4. That is, we set D = 2 (since in Guess 3 the fourth digit is 2). Then the other three digits in {7,8,1,2} (namely 7, 8, and 1) must not appear in the secret.\n\nUnder that assumption:\n\u2003\u2013 From Guess 1 (digits 1,2,3,4) the allowed ones are now only {2,3,4} (since 1 is ruled out by Guess 3\u2019s outcome). We need exactly 2 of these to be in the secret. We already have D = 2, so exactly one of {3,4} must appear.\n\u2003\u2013 From Guess 2 (digits 2,1,5,6) the allowed ones are {2,5,6} (again 1 is ruled out). With D = 2, we need exactly one more from {5,6}.\n\u2003\u2013 Look at Guess 4 (digits 3,5,1,9). With 1 out, the possible digits are {3,5,9}. We need exactly 2 digits here to be bulls\u2014in their positions\u2014and the other digit is not in the secret. Notice that in Guess 4 the positions are: A = 3, B = 5, C = 1, D = 9. We already fixed D = 2 (so the digit in position 4 of secret is not 9); also we cannot use 1. Thus the two bulls must come from positions 1 and 2, which forces A = 3 and B = 5. That also means 9 is not in the secret.\n\nAt this point, our secret has A = 3, B = 5, D = 2. Its digit set is {3,5,?,2}.\n\nNow check Guess 1 again: It should have exactly 2 intersections with {1,2,3,4}. Our secret so far contains 3 and 2, which is exactly 2. Good.\n\nNext, from Guess 2 we need exactly 2 intersections with {2,1,5,6}. Our secret has 2 and 5 from positions D and B. That gives exactly 2, so neither 1 nor 6 is added from Guess 2.\n\nFinally, check Guess 5 (digits 3,6,1,0) with result 1 bull and 1 cow. Our secret so far ({3,5,?,2}) already has 3. In Guess 5, digit 3 is in position 1. Our secret has A = 3, so that would be a bull. To have a total of 2 matching digits, we must have one additional digit among {6,1,0} that appears in the secret but not in the same position as in Guess 5. We already ruled out 1 by Guess 3. And 6 is not allowed by Guess 2\u2019s accounting because we already have {2,5} there. So the remaining candidate is 0.\n\nSince the only missing slot is position C, let\u2019s set C = 0. Then our secret candidate becomes 3 5 0 2.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check against every guess:\n\n\u2022 Guess 1 (1234): Secret {3,5,0,2} \u2229 {1,2,3,4} = {2,3}. In Guess 1, none are in the same positions (since 1 is in pos1, 2 in pos2, 3 in pos3, 4 in pos4, while our secret has 3 in pos1 and 2 in pos4). So result: 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\n\u2022 Guess 2 (2156): Intersection with {2,1,5,6} = {2,5}. In Guess 2, 2 is at pos1 and 5 is at pos3; in secret, 2 is pos4 and 5 is pos2. So 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\n\u2022 Guess 3 (7812): Intersection with {7,8,1,2} = {2}. And in Guess 3, 2 is at position4, and in secret, D = 2. So that gives 1 bull, 0 cows.\n\n\u2022 Guess 4 (3519): Intersection with {3,5,1,9} = {3,5} (since 1 and 9 are not in secret). And they are in positions: Guess 4 has 3 in pos1 and 5 in pos2; our secret has A = 3 and B = 5. So 2 bulls, 0 cows.\n\n\u2022 Guess 5 (3610): Intersection with {3,6,1,0} = {3,0}. And in Guess 5, digit 3 in pos1 is a bull (secret pos1 is 3) and digit 0 is present in secret at pos3 while Guess 5 places it in pos4, yielding a cow. So 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\nAll feedback matches the candidate secret 3502.\n\nThus, my next guess is 3502.\n\nGUESS: 3502"

Let\u2019s update our deductions step by step using all the feedback so far:\n\n1. From Guess 1 (1234, 0 bulls, 2 cows): Exactly two digits among {1,2,3,4} are in the secret, but in different positions than in 1234. With 3 and 2 now ruled out (since 3 and 2 appear in 3502), the only candidates from this set are 1 and 4. Therefore, both 1 and 4 must be in the secret, and neither appears in the position they had in Guess 1 (where 1 was in position 1 and 4 in position 4).\n\n2. Guess 2 (2156, 0 bulls, 2 cows) gives that exactly two digits from {2,1,5,6} are in the secret. With 2 and 5 eliminated (2 is out from Guess 6 and 5 is out because it appears in 3519 which later analysis will rule out), the remaining possible digits are 1 and 6. Since Guess 1 already told us 1 is in the secret, the other must be 6.\n\n3. Guess 3 (7812, 1 bull, 0 cows) tells us that exactly one digit from {7,8,1,2} is in the secret and in the right spot. With 2 eliminated and considering our emerging picture, the only candidate left in that set is 1. Moreover, in Guess 3 the digit 1 appears in position 3. Therefore, 1 must be in position 3 in the secret.\n\n4. Guess 4 (3519, 2 bulls, 0 cows) indicates that exactly two digits from {3,5,1,9} are in the secret and in the right positions. From Guess 6 we know 3 and 5 are not in the secret. Therefore the only candidates are 1 and 9. With 1 already fixed in position 3 (from Guess 3), the digit 9 must be the other bull and must be in its position from Guess 4. In Guess 4, 9 is in position 4, so the secret must have 9 in position 4.\n\n5. Now we know three of the four secret digits: They are 1, 9, and by earlier deduction from Guess 1 we also have 4; and from Guess 2 we have 6. So our secret is made from the digits {1,4,6,9}.\n\n6. We have already fixed that digit 1 is in position 3 and digit 9 is in position 4. This leaves positions 1 and 2 to be occupied by 4 and 6. However, we must also check the feedback from Guess 5.\n\n7. Guess 5 (3610, 1 bull, 1 cow) involves digits {3,6,1,0}. We\u2019ve eliminated 3 and 0, leaving 6 and 1. We already have 1 in position 3. In Guess 5, digit 1 is in position 3 \u2013 that match would yield a bull. This means that 6 must be present but in a wrong position relative to its position in Guess 5. In Guess 5, digit 6 is in position 2. Therefore, in the secret, 6 cannot be in position 2; it must be in position 1. That forces 4 into the remaining slot, which is position 2.\n\nLet\u2019s quickly verify with every guess:\n\n\u2022 Guess 1 (1234): Secret 6,4,1,9. Common digits are 1 and 4. In Guess 1, 1 is in position 1 and 4 in position 4, while in the secret they appear in positions 3 and 2, respectively \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\n\u2022 Guess 2 (2156): Common digits with secret 6,4,1,9 are 1 and 6. In Guess 2 they appear in positions 2 (1) and 4 (6) while in the secret they appear in positions 3 (1) and 1 (6) \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\n\u2022 Guess 3 (7812): Only common digit is 1, which is in position 3 in both \u2192 1 bull, 0 cows.\n\n\u2022 Guess 4 (3519): Common digits are 1 and 9. In Guess 4, 1 is in position 3 and 9 in position 4; and in the secret, they are in positions 3 and 4 \u2192 2 bulls, 0 cows.\n\n\u2022 Guess 5 (3610): Common digits are 6 and 1. In Guess 5, 1 is in position 3 and 6 in position 2; in the secret, 1 is position 3 (bull) and 6 is position 1 (cow) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\n\u2022 Guess 6 (3502): None of {3,5,0,2} appear in the secret \u2192 0 bulls, 0 cows.\n\nAll feedback is now consistent with the secret being 6 4 1 9.\n\nTherefore, my next guess is 6419.\n\nGUESS: 6419"

Also, since from guess1 we have only one match and it comes from {1,2}, the digits 3 and 4 are ruled out. That leaves for known matches one digit from {1,2} and one from {7,8}.

If the secret had 1 or 2, then we would expect that digit to account for the cow in both guesses. However, guess 3 will help us decide.\n\u2022 Guess 3 (1278) resulted in 0 bulls, 2 cows. Its digits are 1, 2, 7, and 8. If the secret used one of 1 or 2 from guess 1 then only one match would appear here.

Of the possibilities, one natural candidate is to choose 3 from {3,4} and 5 from {5,0} along with 8 (the remaining digit from the pair in guess 3). For example, the candidate secret 3587 works as follows:\n\u2003\u2013 1234 vs 3587: only 3 is common (guess\u2019s 3 is in the 3rd position while secret\u2019s 3 is in 1st) \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 5012 vs 3587: only 5 is common (guess\u2019s 5 in pos1 differs from secret\u2019s 5 in pos2) \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 1278 vs 3587: 7 and 8 are common but in swapped positions \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2013 6197 vs 3587: only 7 is common and appears in the 4th position in both \u2192 1 bull, 0 cows.\nAll responses align perfectly.

For example, a digit like 0 or 1 (common to guess 1 and 2) could be that \u201cshared\u201d correct digit. Or we might have (2) serving double duty (from guess 1 and 3) or (4) from guess 2 and 3. On the other hand, it is also possible the matching digits come from two different groups but then the other (the fourth digit of the secret) must avoid the digits already guessed\u2014so it would have to be one of {8,9} (the only ones not yet referenced). In fact, in every scenario that won\u2019t accidentally give more than one match in any of our previous guesses, the remaining \u201cnew\u201d digits almost always turn out to be among {8, 9}.\n\nA brief look at the possibilities shows that:\n\u2003\u2013 One class of scenarios yields a secret of the form {A, C, 8, 9} where A (the match from guesses 1 and 2) is 0 or 1 and C (the match from guess 3) is 6 or 7.\n\u2003\u2013 Other scenarios force the overlap to occur between guess 2 and 3 (with the common candidate 4) or between guess 1 and 3 (with the common candidate 2). In those cases the secret appears as either {3,4,8,9} or {2,4,8,9} (or even {2,5,8,9}).\n\nTo distinguish between these classes we can test the two digits that occur only in some possibilities from our earlier groups. Notice that if the secret comes from the latter groups (with 4 or 2 as the overlapping match) then it will include at least one of the digits 2 or 3 (since guess 1\u2019s candidate in one scenario would be 3, or in another the overlap is 2). On the other hand, in the scenario where the overlap is 0 or 1 the secret does not include 2 or 3. \n\nSo a good discriminating guess is one that already includes the almost-certain digits 8 and 9 (because in every possibility these appear to \u201cfill out\u201d the secret) plus the two digits 3 and 2. Then:\n\u2003\u2013 If the secret comes from the scenario with 0/1 and 6/7 (possibility A), the intersection with {8,9,3,2} will be only {8,9} (2 matches).\n\u2003\u2013 But if the secret comes from the other possibilities then {2,8,9} or {3,8,9} will be present (3 matches).\n\nI\u2019ll order the digits so that none lands in a position already ruled out by a match in a previous guess (for example, in guess 1 the digit 3 was in position 4 and 2 was in position 3, so I will swap their positions now).\n\nMy next guess is 3 in position 1, 2 in position 2, 8 in position 3, and 9 in position 4.\n\nGUESS:3289"

(Since we later suspect 1 is not in play, our one digit from this group is among {0, 2, 3}.)\n\n\u2022 From our guess 4567 we got 0 bulls and 2 cows. That tells us exactly two digits among {4, 5, 6, 7} are in the secret number. \n\n\u2022 Our guess 8614 gave 0 bulls and 2 cows. Notice it uses digits 8, 6, 1, 4. Combining with previous feedback, the likely common digits in these guesses are 4 and 6:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In guess 4567 the two \u201chits\u201d are best explained by digits 4 and 6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In guess 8614 the two cows then come from 4 and 6 (appearing in positions that differ from secret positions).\nSo we can take it that 4 and 6 are in the secret.\n  \n\u2022 Now the secret has 4 unique digits. One comes from {0, 2, 3} (from guess 0123) and two we now believe are 4 and 6. That totals three. The fourth digit is not in guess1 or guess2 (or has been ruled out from guess3 because 1 and 8 didn\u2019t contribute), so it must come from {7, 9} or possibly the remaining digits. However, recall from guess 4567 that only two digits from {4,5,6,7} are present. Since we already \u201cuse\u201d 4 and 6, the other candidate from that group (5 or 7) cannot be in the secret. Also, since 8 and 1 didn\u2019t work in guess 8614 for bull/cow count, the only plausible candidate left from the remaining digits is 9. \n\nThus our strong candidate set is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 One digit from {0, 2, 3}\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 And the confirmed digits 4, 6, and (by elimination) 9.\n\nNow, before narrowing further, we\u2019d like to test which candidate from {0,2,3} is present.

I\u2019ll choose 3 for this trial guess. I must also carefully assign positions so that in the previous guesses the positions ruled out remain avoided. For example, in guess 0123 digit 3 was in the fourth position, so if 3 is in the secret it cannot be in that same position; similarly, in guess 4567 and guess 8614, digits 4 and 6 appear in positions that contributed as cows.\n\nA promising arrangement is to try 3 in the first position and then follow with 9, 4, and 6 arranged to avoid the earlier pitfalls:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In guess 4567, 4 was position 1 and 6 was position 3, so we want them in different positions.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In guess 8614, 6 was in the second position and 4 in the fourth; we want to avoid those positions for the corresponding digits.\n\nOne such ordering is 3, 9, 4, 6:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In guess 0123, the common digit would be 3 (remember, in 0123 digit 3 was in position 4, and here it\u2019s in position 1) \u2192 a cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In guess 4567, the common digits are 4 and 6. Here 4 is in position 3 and 6 in position 4; comparing to guess 4567 where they are in positions 1 and 3, neither is in the same position \u2192 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In guess 8614, again the common digits (4 and 6) are placed as cows.\n  \nThis guess \u201c3946\u201d will help us learn if the secret\u2019s digit from {0, 2, 3} is indeed 3 (if we get the same kinds of clues as before) or if we must consider the alternatives.\n\nI\u2019ll now use 3946 as my next guess.\n\nGUESS: 3946"

        "content": "From our previous feedback, we can deduce the following:\n\n\u2022 Guess 0123 (0 bulls, 1 cow) tells us that exactly one digit from {0,1,2,3} is in the secret. Because later clues become clearer, it now seems that digit is 2 (since using 3 or 0 causes other conflicts and 1 would raise conflicts with another guess).\n\n\u2022 Guess 4567 (0 bulls, 2 cows) tells us that exactly two digits from {4,5,6,7} are in the secret. In combination with our other clues, a good candidate pair here is {4,7} rather than {4,6} or {6,7}.\n\n\u2022 Guess 8614 (0 bulls, 2 cows) uses digits {8,6,1,4}. With 1 not favored from guess\u2081 and given our candidates from {4,5,6,7}, the two correct digits here come out as 4 (from our candidate pair {4,7}) and 8 if we choose 8 as the extra digit outside the previous two groups. (Notice that if 8 were not included, guess\u2083 would yield only 1 hit.)\n\n\u2022 Finally, guess 3946 (0 bulls, 1 cow) with digits {3,9,4,6} shows that only one of these is in the secret. If we already have 4 as a candidate from the {4,7} pair, then neither 3, 9, nor 6 can be in it.\n\nPutting these together, a consistent candidate for the secret\u2019s set of digits is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 One digit from {0,1,2,3} \u2192 2\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Two digits from {4,5,6,7} \u2192 4 and 7\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 And the remaining digit from the other unused numbers \u2192 8\n\nSo our candidate digit set becomes {2, 4, 7, 8}.\n\nThere is also positional information from the fact that all our previous guesses had 0 bulls. For example:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Guess 0123 had 2 in the third position, so 2 cannot be in position 3.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In guess 4567, 4 was in position 1 and 7 was in position 4, so 4 cannot be in pos1 and 7 cannot be in pos4.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In guess 8614, 4 was in position 4 and 8 was in position 1, so 4 cannot be in pos4 and 8 cannot be in pos1.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In guess 3946, 4 appeared in position 3; thus 4 cannot be in position 3 either.\n\nCombining constraints for digit 4:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 It cannot be pos1 (from 4567), pos3 (from 3946), or pos4 (from 8614). That forces 4 to be in position 2.\n\nWith secret digits {2,4,7,8} and 4 fixed in pos2, a candidate ordering that respects the other restrictions is as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 was in guess 0123 (pos3) so 2 can be placed in pos4, for instance.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 7 must avoid pos4 (from guess 4567). It can safely go in pos1.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 8 must avoid pos1 (from guess 8614), so it can go in pos3.\nA resulting permutation is: position 1 = 7, position 2 = 4, position 3 = 8, position 4 = 2.\n\nThis ordering (7 4 8 2) is consistent with all the given feedback if none of our previous guesses had any digit coinciding with the secret position.\n\nI\u2019ll now try the guess 7482.\n\nGUESS: 7482"

(So, for example, candidates 4 and 7 or 4 and 6, etc.)\n\n3) Guess 8614 \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows  \n\u2003\u2022 This guess\u2019s digits are {8,6,1,4}. With the previous information, it\u2019s natural to suspect that the two hits are 8 and 4 (if we suppose that from 4567 the two hits were 4 and 7, then from 8614 the common ones would be 8 and 4).\n\n4) Guess 3946 \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow  \n\u2003\u2022 Of these digits {3,9,4,6}, only one is in the secret. Since we already seem to have a strong candidate for 4 from the other guesses, this suggests that among 3,9,4,6 only 4 appears (and it must be misplaced in this guess).\n\nNow let\u2019s see what the combined picture suggests:\n\n\u2022 From guess 4567 we get exactly two digits from {4,5,6,7} are in the secret. If we take 4 as a hit (supported by guess 8614 and 3946) then that leaves exactly one among the remaining {5,6,7}.  \n\u2022 In guess 8614 the two \u201chits\u201d are most easily explained as 8 and 4 appearing, so it implies that 8 is in and 6 and 1 are not.\n\u2022 From guess 0123, exactly one digit from {0,1,2,3} is in the secret. Since 1 and 3 appear suspect in other clues, the candidate here is 0 (or 2) \u2014 yet note that 0 is already in guess 0123 and if it were the digit from that guess, it would produce the one cow.\n\u2003\u2003At this point, a promising candidate set is: one digit from {0,2} (we will decide in a moment), plus the two already from {4,5,6,7} which we lean toward 4 along with the other hit being 7 (since 7 is in 4567 and not contradicted by guess 8614), and then digit 8 from guess 8614.\n\u2022 Also, guess 3946 confirms that aside from 4, none of {3,9,6} appear.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at our fifth guess, 7482, which gave 2 bulls and 1 cow. Its digits are 7, 4, 8, 2. Because we now suspect that the secret\u2019s hits from previous information are 4, 7, and 8, we interpret the feedback as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 Three of the digits in 7482 are in the secret, and one digit is not. Since we already believe 7, 4, and 8 are in the secret, the digit \u201c2\u201d must be the one that is not.\n\u2003\u2022 Also, exactly 2 of these digits are exactly positioned (bulls) while the remaining correct digit is misplaced (cow).\n\nA set of candidate secret digits then becomes {7, 4, 8} plus the one digit from the group {0,1,2,3}. But since \u201c2\u201d appears in guess 7482 and we\u2019ve now ruled out 2 (because that guess only had three correct digits, and they are 7, 4, 8), the digit from {0,1,2,3} must be 0 (it could also be 1 or 3, but 1 and 3 seem ruled out from other guesses\u2014in guess 8614 we already dismissed 1, and guess 3946 had 3 as a possibility but that would have increased the hit count there).\n\nSo a very consistent candidate so far is the digit set {7,4,8,0}.\n\nNow let\u2019s check positional constraints from the previous guesses:\n\n\u2022 Guess 4567 (digits: 4 in pos1, 5 in pos2, 6 in pos3, 7 in pos4) produced 0 bulls.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, if 4 is in the secret it cannot be in pos1, and if 7 is in the secret it cannot be in pos4.\n\u2022 Guess 8614 (digits: 8,6,1,4 in positions 1\u20134) produced 0 bulls.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, 8 cannot be in pos1 and 4 cannot be in pos4.\n\u2022 Guess 3946 (digits: 3,9,4,6 with 4 in pos3) produced 0 bulls.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, 4 cannot be in pos3.\n\u2022 Guess 0123 (digits: 0,1,2,3 with 0 in pos1) produced its one cow.\n\u2003\u2003If 0 is the digit from {0,1,2,3} in the secret, it cannot be in pos1.\n\nNow consider our candidate secret digits {7,4,8,0} and a possible ordering that fits the constraints:\n- 4 cannot be in pos1 (from 4567) or pos3 (from 3946) or pos4 (from 8614). That forces 4 to be in pos2.\n- 8 cannot be in pos1 (from 8614). \n- 7 should not be in pos4 (from 4567).\n\nOne ordering that fits is:\n\u2003S1 = 7, S2 = 4, S3 = 0, S4 = 8.\n\nLet\u2019s verify it against the most recent guess (7482) which had feedback 2 bulls, 1 cow:\n\u2003Guess 7482 compared to candidate 7,4,0,8:\n\u2003\u2003Pos1: guess 7 vs secret 7 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003Pos2: guess 4 vs secret 4 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003Pos3: guess 8 vs secret 0 \u2192 not match.\n\u2003\u2003Pos4: guess 2 vs secret 8 \u2192 not match.\n\u2003Then \u201c8\u201d from the secret appears in guess (in pos3) \u2192 that is a cow.\n\u2003Thus, 2 bulls and 1 cow, which fits.\n\nWe already checked the other guesses:\n\u2003\u2022 0123: secret contains 0 (secret pos3 vs guess pos1) \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2022 4567: secret\u2019s 7 and 4 produce 2 cows (positions differ from pos4 and pos1, respectively).\n\u2003\u2022 8614: secret\u2019s 8 and 4 produce 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 3946: secret\u2019s 4 (secret pos2 vs guess pos3) gives 1 cow.\n\nEverything is consistent with secret = 7,4,0,8.\n\nThus I will make the next guess as 7408.\n\nGUESS: 7408"

Notice also in guess 3946 having exactly one common digit forces 4 to be that digit while 6 (and 3,9) are excluded. Looking at guess 7482, we want three common digits. One way is to have the candidate set be {2,4,5,8} or {2,4,7,8}. However, testing set {2,4,7,8} against guess 7482 would yield four common digits (since guess \u201c7482\u201d has all four if the secret were {2,4,7,8}). Instead, if we take {2,4,5,8} then:\n\u2003\u2013 From guess 0123: only \u201c2\u201d is common.\n\u2003\u2013 From guess 4567: common digits are {4,5} (exactly 2).\n\u2003\u2013 From guess 8614: common digits are {4,8} (exactly 2).\n\u2003\u2013 From guess 3946: common digit is {4} (exactly 1).\n\u2003\u2013 From guess 7482 (\u201c7,4,8,2\u201d): the intersection with {2,4,5,8} is {2,4,8} (3 digits), which is consistent with getting a total of 2 bulls and 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 From guess 7408 (\u201c7,4,0,8\u201d): the intersection is {4,8} (2 digits) as required to yield 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\nThe next step is to assign positions to the candidate digits in a way that each guess\u2019s bull constraints is met. Let our secret be S1 S2 S3 S4 = a permutation of {2,4,5,8}. From our constraints:\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 0123 (digits: 0,1,2,3 with \u201c2\u201d in position 3) forces if 2 is the common digit from that guess then 2 cannot be in position 3.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 4567 (digits: 4 in pos1, 5 in pos2) gives 0 bulls so 4 cannot be in pos1 and 5 cannot be in pos2.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 8614 (digits: 8 in pos1, 4 in pos4) forces 8 cannot be in pos1 and 4 cannot be in pos4.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 3946 (4 in pos3) forces 4 not to be in position 3.\n\u2003\u2022 Moreover, guess 7482 (\u201c7,4,8,2\u201d) must yield exactly 2 bulls and 1 cow. Its positions are: pos1=7, pos2=4, pos3=8, pos4=2. Since our secret (a subset of these digits) is {2,4,5,8} (note that 7 is not present), we obtain an intersection of {2,4,8}. It is natural then to try assigning the positions so that exactly two of those digits land in the same positions as in guess 7482 while the third appears elsewhere.\n\u2003\u2022 Finally, guess 7408 (\u201c7,4,0,8\u201d) has positions: pos1=7, pos2=4, pos3=0, pos4=8. Its intersection with our candidate {2,4,5,8} is {4,8} and these must appear with one in its correct spot and the other in a different one.\n\nOne arrangement that meets all these constraints is:\n\u2003S1 = 2, S2 = 4, S3 = 8, S4 = 5.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\u2022 Guess 0123: Compare (0,1,2,3) to (2,4,8,5).

In guess, 4 is in pos3 while secret has 4 in pos2 \u2192 cow. (0 bulls, 1 cow)\n\u2022 Guess 7482: Compare (7,4,8,2) to (2,4,8,5). Their intersection is {2,4,8}. Check positions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos1: guess has 7, not in secret.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos2: guess has 4, and secret S2 = 4 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos3: guess has 8, secret S3 = 8 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos4: guess has 2, secret S1 = 2 \u2192 cow.\nThat yields 2 bulls and 1 cow.\n\u2022 Guess 7408: Compare (7,4,0,8) to (2,4,8,5).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos1: guess has 7 (not present);\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos2: guess has 4, secret S2=4 \u2192 bull;\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos3: guess has 0 (not present);\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos4: guess has 8, but secret\u2019s 8 is in pos3 \u2192 cow.\nThat gives 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\nAll feedback match!\n\nThus the candidate secret number is 2485.\n\nI will now guess 2485.\n\nGUESS: 2485"

(For example, if the secret\u2019s digit from {1,2,3,4} isn\u2019t 1 then 1 would be the extra digit in 0159; or if the secret\u2019s digit from {5,6,7,8} isn\u2019t 5 then 5 is extra.)\n\nTo help decide which digit in the first group is correct, I want to see what happens when we \u201cswap\u201d 1 with another candidate from {1,2,3,4}. In 0159 we already see a possibility, but if we try 1259 instead, then exactly one of 1 and 2 will be in the secret because we\u2019re still only allowed one from that group. Compare:\n\u2013 If the secret has 1 (and not 2) then in 1259 only 1 (plus 9 and perhaps one digit from the second group if it happens to be 5) will be counted from the pair 1\u20132.\n\u2013 If instead the secret uses 2 then 1 will be the odd one out.\nAlso, note that if (as in one possibility) the secret\u2019s candidate from the {5,6,7,8} group is 5, then by using 5 and 9 (which from our 0159 feedback are likely in the secret when paired with one of 0 or 1/2) we should see a difference in the cow count.\n\nThus, guessing 1259 should help us distinguish whether the secret\u2019s digit from {1,2,3,4} is 1 or 2 (and, by extension, whether the candidate from {5,6,7,8} is 5 or not). Depending on whether we get 2 or 3 cows, the next step will become clearer.\n\nGUESS: 1259"

Moreover, the candidate from {5,6,7,8} must be 5; and to match the counts, both 0 and 9 must be present in the set for one of our scenarios. Consistency with all previous feedback leaves us with exactly two possibilities:\n\u2003Secret = {0,3,5,9}\u2003or\u2003Secret = {0,4,5,9}.\n\nTo decide between these two options we need a guess that \u201ctests\u201d the ambiguity. In our next guess we want to include both 3 and 4 even though we know only one of them is in S. In addition we include two digits that we are sure about (0 and 5) and omit 9 (since it is common to both possibilities). Then the total number of matching digits (regardless of bulls versus cows) will differ:\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret is {0,3,5,9}, our guess will hit 0, 3, and 5 (three correct digits).\n\u2003\u2022 If instead the secret is {0,4,5,9}, it will register 0 and 5 (only two).\nI propose to \u201cspread out\u201d the digits so as not to accidentally hit any bull positions (remember our earlier guesses restrict some digits from being in certain spots: 0 isn\u2019t allowed in position 1; 5 shouldn\u2019t be in position 3; also, from our first guess, if 3 is the candidate then it cannot be in position 3, and if 4 is the candidate then it can\u2019t be in position 4).\n\nOne arrangement that respects these constraints is to use the guess:\n\u2003Position\u202f1: 3\u2003\u2013 (candidate from {3,4})\n\u2003Position\u202f2: 0\u2003\u2013 (0 is not allowed in pos1, so pos2 is fine)\n\u2003Position\u202f3: 7\u2003\u2013 (an extra \u201cdummy\u201d digit; 7 is not in the secret because the candidate from {5,6,7,8} is 5)\n\u2003Position\u202f4: 5\u2003\u2013 (5 is safe here because 5 is forbidden only from position 3)\nThis guess, 3075, contains 3 and 0 and 5 from our \u201csure\u201d set and substitutes 7 for 4/9. Notice:\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret is {0,3,5,9}, then 3, 0, and 5 belong to it (three digits match).\n\u2003\u2022 If instead the secret is {0,4,5,9}, then only 0 and 5 are present among the guessed digits (two digits match).\nThus, the total count of matching digits reported (bulls+cows) will differ between the two cases and help us decide whether the group\u20111 candidate is 3 or 4.\n\nI\u2019ll now make this guess.\n\nGUESS: 3075"

This sets up two scenarios:\n\u2022 Either the secret\u2019s digit from {0,1,2,3} is 2 \u2013 in which case secret has 2 plus one more digit from {4,5,6} (because 2 already accounts for the one digit in the first group, and we need a total of 2 from the second group).\n\u2022 Or the secret\u2019s digit from {0,1,2,3} is 0, 1, or 3 \u2013 in which case secret has none of the digit 2, and must include two digits from {4,5,6}.\n\nTo help distinguish these, I\u2019ll construct a guess that uses exactly one candidate digit from the first group (choosing 2) and two from the second group (say 4 and 5) and include one new digit to expand our probe. I must also avoid positions that we already know are impossible for these digits (from our previous feedback). For example, since 2 was in position 3 in 0123 and in position 2 in 4256, we can try placing 2 in position 1; 4 was in position 1 in 4256 so we can place it in a different slot (I\u2019ll put it in position 3); and 5 was in position 3 in 4256 so I\u2019ll put it in position 4. I add a new digit 7 into position 2. \n\nThis guess, 2745, will help clarify whether 2 is indeed the candidate from {0,1,2,3} and which other digit from {4,5,6} might be present. \n\nGUESS: 2745"

In our second guess (4256) we got two cows from {4, 2, 5, 6} and from our third guess (2745) we again got two cows for digits {2, 7, 4, 5}. (Remember that every secret digit appears only once.) But note that digit 2 appears in both groups, so we have two possible scenarios:\n\n\u2022 Option 1: The secret\u2019s unique digit from {0,1,2,3} is 2. Then among the digits in {4,2,5,6} one \u201chit\u201d is 2 and the other must be either 4, 5, or 6. (And the feedback from guess 2745, which uses two of {2,4,5}, is explained by whether the extra digit is 4 or 5.)\n\n\u2022 Option 2: The secret\u2019s digit from {0,1,2,3} is not 2 (so it is 0, 1, or 3), and then the two \u201chits\u201d from {4,2,5,6} must both come from {4,5,6} (with 2 being absent). But then look at guess 2745 (which gives two cows) whose common digits from {2,7,4,5} must come from the two digits 4 and 5 (if 2 is not present), limiting the possibilities from that group.\n\nThere is an additional positional restriction. For example, if 2 is in the secret (Option 1) then it cannot be in any position where it was guessed in previous rounds. In guess 0123 digit 2 was in position 3, in guess 4256 2 was in position 2, and in guess 2745 2 was in position 1. So in Option 1 the digit 2 would have to be in position 4. In Option 2, 2 is not used and the two digits from the group are likely 4 and 5 (because a third possibility would add extra matches in guess 2745).\n\nTo help us distinguish (and especially to test whether 2 is in the secret \u2013 and if it is, it must appear in the fourth position), I propose a guess that puts 2 in position 4 and rearranges a couple of digits from our earlier clues. For example, consider the guess 4 7 8 2. Here digit 2 is in position 4; if Option 1 holds (with 2 included) then that will produce at least one bull (if 2 really is in pos4) along with additional cows from whichever digit among 4 or 5 is the extra one. In contrast, if Option 2 holds (with 2 absent and with 4 and 5 in the secret) then using 4 in position 1 may or may not produce a bull and the overall score should differ. (For instance, if 2 is absent, a secret such as {1,4,5,9} might produce no bull for the 2 and only one bull or cow for the 4 depending on its placement.) In short, the outcome from 4782 will let us tell if 2 is present and, by extension, narrow down the remaining candidates.\n\nI now propose the next guess as 4782.\n\nGUESS: 4782"

Checking guess1, though, we see that if it were 0 or 3 the cow would have come when 0 was in pos1 or 3 in pos4 (possibly giving a bull if placed similarly in the secret), so the only viable candidate turns out to be 1. Then turn to the hits in the other groups:\n\u2003\u2022 Guess2 (4256) gave 2 cows and with 2 dismissed the two hits must come from {4,5,6} \u2013 and similarly,\n\u2003\u2022 Guess3 (2745) gave 2 cows and with 2 dismissed the two hits come from {7,4,5}. \nTheir intersection is {4,5}.

Therefore, exactly one digit from {0, 1, 2, 3} is in the secret (but not in its original position).\n\u2022 Guess2 (4256) gave 0 bulls and 2 cows. So exactly two digits among {4, 2, 5, 6} are in the secret.\n\u2022 Guess3 (2745) gave 0 bulls and 2 cows, meaning exactly two digits from {2, 7, 4, 5} are in the secret.\n\u2022 Guess4 (4782) resulted in 0 bulls and 1 cow, so among {4, 7, 8, 2} exactly one digit is in the secret.\n\u2022 Guess5 (5914) produced 0 bulls and 1 cow, meaning exactly one digit among {5, 9, 1, 4} is in the secret.\n\nSetting up indicator equations (with x_d = 1 if digit d is in the secret, else 0) produces a system whose solution shows that the secret must contain exactly four digits. A careful analysis leads to the following restrictions on membership:\n\n\u2003\u2022 From Guess1: x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 = 1, so exactly one digit from {0, 1, 2, 3} is used.\n\u2003\u2022 From Guesses 2\u20135 it turns out that digits 5, 6, and 7 appear consistently as hits, while digit 2 appears to drop out and digits 4, 1, 9 are ruled out by later equations.\n\u2003\u2022 Working through the equations reveals x5 = 1, x6 = 1, and x7 = 1.\n\u2003\u2022 Moreover, equation (1) forces that exactly one of {0, 1, 2, 3} is used, and with 1 and 2 ruled out by other equations, the \u201cextra\u201d digit is either 0 or 3.\n\nThus the secret\u2019s digit set is narrowed down to either {0, 5, 6, 7} or {3, 5, 6, 7}.\n\nAdditional restrictions based on the positions in our guesses (remember no bull ever occurred, so whenever a digit appeared it was not in its secret position) further constrain the secret\u2019s arrangement. For example, note that in Guess1 the digit 0 was in position 1, so if 0 is in the secret it cannot be in position 1; similarly, Guess1 had 3 in position 4 so if 3 is in the secret, it cannot be in position 4. Also, analyze the other guesses:\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess5, 5 was at position 1, and in Guess2 and Guess3 it was at positions (pos3 and pos4) so 5 is forced to be in position 2.\n\u2003\u2013 In addition, analysis of Guesses2\u20134 forces 6 to avoid position 4 and 7 to avoid position 2.\nAfter working through these constraints one sees that no matter the exact ordering, the only uncertainty is whether the extra digit is 0 or 3.\n\nTo differentiate these two possibilities, we can design a guess that uses the four digits {3, 5, 6, 7}. Notice that if the secret is {3, 5, 6, 7} then all four digits are hits (while if it is {0, 5, 6, 7}, then only three will match). In fact, no matter how the secret arranges its digits (subject to its restrictions) the common total (bulls plus cows) when comparing our new guess with the secret will come out as 4 if the extra digit is 3 and as 3 if the extra digit is 0.\n\nOne good candidate is to use the permutation 7 6 3 5. Let\u2019s check the idea:\n\nIf the secret\u2019s digit set is {3, 5, 6, 7} then because our previous analysis forces 5 to be in position 2 and 7 tends to fall in position 4 while 3 and 6 must occupy the remaining two positions (with 3 not allowed in position 4 and 6 not allowed in position 4), the secret arrangement is forced (up to a swap of 3 and 6). For example, suppose the secret is (3,5,6,7). Then comparing to our guess 7-6-3-5:\n\u2003\u2013 7 (guess pos1) is in secret pos4 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 6 (guess pos2) is in secret pos3 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 3 (guess pos3) is in secret pos1 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 5 (guess pos4) is in secret pos2 \u2192 cow.\nTotal: 0 bulls, 4 cows.\nIf instead the secret were (6,5,3,7), then one digit might accidentally fall in the same position (for instance, the digit 3 may align) resulting in something like 1 bull, 3 cows. In any event the total number of matched digits would be 4.\n\nNow consider if the secret digits were instead {0, 5, 6, 7}. Then only {5, 6, 7} are common. No matter how the secret arranges these (recalling that 5 must be in pos2, 6 not in pos4, and 0 is not 3), the total common count (bulls+cows) will be 3.\n\nThus, by guessing 7635 we should receive feedback whose total (bulls+cows) is either 4 (in which case the extra digit is 3) or 3 (in which case it is 0).\n\nI therefore propose the next guess as 7635.\n\nGUESS: 7635"

Then the secret cannot have 7 in the positions where it was guessed in other rounds. \n\nOne arrangement meeting all these position restrictions is:\n\u2003Position1: 7  \n\u2003Position2: 5  \n\u2003Position3: 6  \n\u2003Position4: 0\n\nLet\u2019s quickly check against the feedback:\n\u2003\u2013 Guess1: 0123; only 0 is present (in pos4 versus pos1) \u2192 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess2: 4256; 5 (guessed pos3, secret pos2) and 6 (guessed pos4, secret pos3) \u2192 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess3: 2745; 7 (guessed pos2, secret pos1) and 5 (guessed pos4, secret pos2) \u2192 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess4: 4782; 7 (guessed pos2, secret pos1) \u2192 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess5: 5914; 5 (guessed pos1, secret pos2) \u2192 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess6: 7635; 7 in pos1 is a bull, while 6 and 5 appear in different positions \u2192 1 bull and 2 cows.\n\nEverything fits. So our best candidate is 7 in the first, 5 in the second, 6 in the third, and 0 in the fourth position.\n\nI will now make the next guess as 7560.\n\nGUESS: 7560"

In guess 1234 we got 0 bulls and 2 cows, meaning exactly two of its digits (from the set {1,2,3,4}) are in the secret, but in different positions. Then in guess 5126 (digits {5,1,2,6}) we also got 0 bulls and 2 cows. Notice that the digits 1 and 2 appear in both guesses. Let\u2019s define three groups based on these observations:\n\n\u2022 Group A: {1,2} \u2013 common to both guesses,\n\u2022 Group B: {3,4} \u2013 the other two digits from guess 1234,\n\u2022 Group C: {5,6} \u2013 the other two digits from guess 5126.\n\nFor guess 1234, if we call \u201ca\u201d the count of Group A digits present and \u201cb\u201d for Group B, we have a + b = 2. For guess 5126, with \u201ca\u201d from Group A and \u201cc\u201d for Group C, we have a + c = 2. The only possibility (remember a, b, c can be 0, 1, or 2) is a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1. That is, exactly one digit from each group appears in the secret.\n\nNow turn to guess 0789, which gave 1 bull and 0 cows. None of its digits besides that one bull is in the secret number. And since none of 1,2,3,4,5,6 can be from 0789, the secret\u2019s fourth digit must come from {0,7,8,9}. Also, because the bull occurred in the same position as in the guess, the one candidate from {0,7,8,9} is in a specific position\u2014for example, if it were 7 in position 2 (since guess 0789 has 7 in second position), then the secret\u2019s second digit is 7. We now know that the secret\u2019s four digits consist of one digit from each of these groups:\n\u2003\u2022 one from Group A: {1,2},\n\u2003\u2022 one from Group B: {3,4},\n\u2003\u2022 one from Group C: {5,6},\n\u2003\u2022 one from Group D: {0,7,8,9} (with its bull in the same position as in guess 0789).\n\nTo gather further clues about which candidate from each group is the secret and about their positions, I\u2019ll propose a guess that takes one candidate from each group and reorders them. In the guess below I choose:\n\u2003\u2013 from Group A, I test 2,\n\u2003\u2013 from Group D, I choose 7 (recalling that 7 was in position 2 in guess 0789),\n\u2003\u2013 from Group B, I choose 3,\n\u2003\u2013 from Group C, I choose 5.\nI then arrange these as follows:\n\u2003Position 1: 2\u2003\u2003Position 2: 7\u2003\u2003Position 3: 3\u2003\u2003Position 4: 5\n\nThis guess (2735) uses one candidate from each group and, by comparing its bulls and cows with previous guesses, we will narrow down which digits are really in the secret number and what their positions are.\n\nGUESS: 2735"

A promising scenario was as follows:\n\n\u2022 Assume the common digit is 2 from group A.\n\u2022 Assume the candidate from group B is 4 (so that from 1234 the digits 2 and 4 appear, giving 2 cows).\n\u2022 Assume the candidate from group C is 6 (so that from 5126 the digits 2 and 6 appear as cows).\n\u2022 And let the Group D candidate be 7 (which appears in guess 0789 and\u2014if placed correctly\u2014yields 1 bull there).\n\nA secret number built from these would be {2,4,6,7}.

In particular, the guess 0789\u2019s 1 bull suggests that the secret\u2019s Group D digit appears in the same spot as in 0789 (i.e. one of its positions). Clues from 2735 (which yielded 1 bull and 1 cow) strongly point toward 7 occupying that bull position\u2014namely position 2\u2014so we take the Group D candidate as 7 in position 2.\n\nThen, comparing 1234 and 5126, and noting their common digits {1,2}, we are led to assume that exactly one digit from {1,2} is in the secret. In our working, we choose the alternative option for the \u201cnon\u2010bull\u201d groups (when compared to the guess 4762 we just made) so that in each group we decide whether the digit from 4762 is \u201cin place\u201d (producing a bull) or not present at all. Because our guess 4762 (which used for positions: 1:4 from Group B, 2:7 from Group D, 3:6 from Group C, 4:2 from Group A) resulted in 2 bulls and 0 cows, exactly two of those groups must have contributed the guess digit in the correct position while in the other two groups the secret chose its alternative candidate (so that the guess\u2019s digit does not appear anywhere). One good combination that fits all earlier responses is to have:\n\n\u2003\u2013 Group B: choose 4 (matching guess \u201c4762\u201d at position 1)  \n\u2003\u2013 Group D: choose 7 (matching position 2; also supported by guess 0789)  \n\u2003\u2013 Group C: instead of the guess\u2019s 6 choose 5 (so no bull in position 3)  \n\u2003\u2013 Group A: instead of the guess\u2019s 2 choose 1 (so no bull in position 4)\n\nThen the secret\u2019s four digits are {4, 7, 5, 1} and we must assign them consistently with previous clues. A fitting ordering is to fix the known bull from Group B at position 1 and Group D at position 2, then assign the remaining two digits (from Groups C and A) to positions 3 and 4 so that earlier responses are met. One viable ordering is:\n\n\u2003Position 1: 4  \n\u2003Position 2: 7  \n\u2003Position 3: 5  \n\u2003Position 4: 1\n\nChecking quickly against previous guesses:\n\u2003\u2022 1234: Only digits 4 (in secret pos1) and 1 (in secret pos4) are present but in different spots \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.  \n\u2003\u2022 5126: Only digits 5 and 1 appear (and in different positions) \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.  \n\u2003\u2022 0789: Only 7 is common and in position 2 \u2192 1 bull, 0 cows.  \n\u2003\u2022 2735: Comparing (2,7,3,5) with (4,7,5,1) gives bull at position 2 (7) and one cow (digit 5 appears in secret but in a different position) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.  \n\u2003\u2022 4762: Comparing (4,7,6,2) with (4,7,5,1) gives bulls exactly at positions 1 and 2 (4 and 7) with neither 6 nor 2 appearing anywhere else \u2192 2 bulls, 0 cows.\n\nEvery past response is consistent with secret = 4,7,5,1.\n\nI will now try guess 4751.\n\nGUESS: 4751"

Its digits are 1, 2, 3, 4. Out of these, secret currently has 1.

For example, if we take 0, 1, and 2 as our suspected digits (thus hypothesizing that 3 might be the one that isn\u2019t in the secret), we must place them in positions different from their original ones (0 was in pos1, 1 in pos2, and 2 in pos3).

Noting the common digits between the guesses, it appears that the digits 1, 0, and 2 are very likely in the secret, while the digits 3 and 4 are not.\n\u2022 Analyzing the positions:\n\u2003\u2013 In guess 0123, since there were no bulls, none of the digits appeared in the same position as in the secret.

That tells us that exactly three of the digits in 0, 1, 2, 3 are in the secret number but all are in the wrong positions. One of these digits is not present at all.\n\u2022 Guess 2 was 1402 and produced 2 bulls and 1 cow. Its digits are 1, 4, 0, and 2. Since guess 1 had 0,1,2,3 and we got three correct, it strongly indicates that among 0, 1, and 2 (which appear in both guesses) two or all three could be in the secret. In guess 2 we have 1, 4, and 0 in common with guess 1 if we assume 2 was the digit that did not appear in the secret. Then the three correct digits in guess 2 would be 1, 0, and 4. Getting 2 bulls means that two of these were in the correct positions, while one was present but misplaced.\n\u2022 Guess 3 was 1052 and produced 1 bull and 1 cow. Its digits are 1, 0, 5, and 2. Now, if we hypothesize that the secret number is made from the three digits that appeared in both guess 1 and guess 2 (namely 1, 0, and one among 2 or 4), then guess 3 shows that only two of the digits (from 1,0,5,2) are correct. Since 5 appears for the first time and 2 was already in guess 1 (which had three correct digits) but now isn\u2019t contributing, it is consistent to consider that 2 might be the extra digit from guess 1. That would mean the digits in the secret are 1, 0, plus the remaining two from guess 1: out of {0,1,2,3} if 2 is missing then 3 is a candidate. And from guess 2 we would then have inserted 4 to reach three correct digits. In other words, a consistent possibility is that the secret\u2019s digits are {1, 0, 3, 4}.\n\nLet\u2019s see if we can assign positions.

(One digit among these isn\u2019t in the secret.) Because the first guess already yielded three correct digits (all misplaced) from {0,1,2,3}, it is natural to suspect that one of these four is \u201cextra.\u201d One possible scenario is that the digit 3 from the set {0,1,2,3} is present while 2 is not (or vice versa). We must see which choice meshes with later feedback.\n \n\u2022 The third guess 1052 (digits {1,0,5,2}) produced 1 bull and 1 cow. Its intersection with the first guess\u2019s digits must be consistent with having only 2 of them correct. \n\n\u2022 The fourth guess 1430 (digits {1,4,3,0}) produced 1 bull and 2 cows. Since this guess uses four digits, its total of 3 \u201ccorrect digits\u201d indicates that one of these appears in the secret while the other three do not. In other words, the secret\u2019s digit set does not match all of them.\n\nAfter cycling through possibilities, one scenario that fits is to assume that from the first guess {0,1,2,3} exactly three are in the secret and omit 1 candidate. In the end a candidate set that meets all constraints is to have the secret\u2019s digits be {3,4,1,2} (so the digit 2 is present here even though that means the \u201cmissing\u201d one from guess1 is 0 or that the extra digit from later guesses is 4).

(Remember, each digit appears at most once.)\n\u2022 Guess 3: 2708 \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow. And note that {2, 7, 0, 8} shares two digits (2 and 0) with Guess 2.\n\nA key observation is that between Guesses 2 and 3 the common digits are 2 and 0. Since Guess 2 had two matches in {2,0,5,6} while Guess 3 (which shares 2 and 0) has exactly one match, it means the secret contains exactly one digit from {2, 0}. \n\nThat leaves us with two mutually exclusive possibilities:\n\nPossibility A:\n\u2003\u2022 The secret contains 2 (fulfilling the \u201cone from {2,7,0,8}\u201d in Guess 3 and the \u201cone from {1,2,3,4}\u201d in Guess 1), and then the other digit from Guess 2 must come from {5,6}.\n\nPossibility B:\n\u2003\u2022 The secret contains 0 (fulfilling the count from Guess 3) and not 2. In that case the digit from Guess 1 must be one of {1, 3, 4} (since 2 is not present).\n\nTo help decide between these alternatives, I\u2019d like to test for the digit that came in Guess 1.

Here\u2019s the reasoning for \u201c3179\u201d:\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret belongs to Possibility A (i.e. it contains 2 rather than any of 1, 3, or 4), then none of these four digits should be present, and we should expect 0 bulls and 0 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 If it\u2019s Possibility B (with one digit chosen from {1, 3, 4} in the secret), then \u201c3179\u201d will register 1 bull or cow (depending on the secret\u2019s placement) because that digit will appear in \u201c3179\u201d.\n\u2003\u2022 The new digits 7 and 9 haven\u2019t appeared in earlier guesses, so they help avoid introducing unnecessary confusion.\n\nThis guess should help us narrow down which branch we\u2019re on.\n\nGUESS: 3179"

Under the branch we\u2019re exploring, that digit is 0 (and note 0 cannot be in the same position as guessed; in \"2708\" it\u2019s in position 3).\n\u2022 Guess 4 (\u201c3179\u201d \u2192 2 bulls, 0 cows) tells us that exactly two of its digits are in the secret and in the same positions. Under our reasoning, the secret cannot include 7 (because that would create extra matches with guess 3), so the matching digits from \u201c3179\u201d come from the other candidates. In fact, if the secret already contains exactly one digit from {1,2,3,4} (and here 2 is ruled out in this branch), then it must be either 1 or 3. In addition, a second matching digit appears from \u201c3179\u201d (namely 9) if we choose it as the extra digit.\n\nWith that in mind one viable candidate for the secret is one containing 0 (from guesses 2 and 3), 1 (or 3) as the sole digit from {1,3,4} (thus satisfying guess 1), plus one digit from {5,6} (to account for the extra match in guess 2), and then the digit 9 (to get the second bull in guess 4). A consistent candidate is to use the digits {0, 1, 5, 9} arranged as follows:\n\n\u2022 Let the bull positions in guess 4 (\"3179\") be the 1 in position 2 and the 9 in position 4. (Note that \u201c3179\u201d then does not contribute any cows from the digits not present in the secret.)\n\u2022 Place the 0 and 5 in positions 1 and 3 in an order that fits the previous responses.

In \u201c2056\u201d, 5 is in position 3; in our candidate secret, 5 is also in position 3 \u2192 that gives a bull. Meanwhile, 0 is in position 2 in guess 2 and position 1 in secret \u2192 a cow. So we get 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Compare with guess 3 \"2708\": The only common digit is 0, and since in guess 3, 0 is in position 3 while in our candidate secret 0 is in position 1, that yields 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Compare with guess 4 \"3179\": The intersection is {1,9}.

Notice that if the matching digit there is 3 (from \"3179\" we might be using 3 as one of the bulls) then in \"1234\" 3 was guessed in position 3 while it might be placed elsewhere in the secret.\n\n\u2022 Guess 2 (\"2056\") resulted in 1 bull and 1 cow.

This automatically makes the feedback from \"3179\" (with bulls at pos1 and pos4) correct.\n\nNow, consider Guess 1 (\"1234\"). Its one common digit can be the 3 (since we are not using 1, ruling out 1). In \"1234\", 3 is at position 3, while in our assumed secret it is at position 1, yielding 0 bulls and 1 cow \u2013 as required.\n\nNext, examine Guess 2 (\"2056\"). With secret so far as [3, ?, ?, 9], we need two digits from {2, 0, 5, 6} with one in the right position and one misplaced. If we set the unknown positions (2 and 3) to 0 and 6 (in some order) we can check consistency. For instance, choose secret = 3, 0, 6, 9.\n\u2022 Compare with \"2056\": Its digits are 2 (pos1), 0 (pos2), 5 (pos3), 6 (pos4). In secret 3,0,6,9:\n\u2003\u2013 The digit 0 is in secret at pos2 and guess \"2056\" has 0 in pos2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2013 The digit 6 is in secret at pos3 while guess \"2056\" puts 6 in pos4 \u2192 cow.\nThat gives 1 bull, 1 cow as needed.\n\nFor Guess 3 (\"2708\"): Its digits are 2, 7, 0, 8. In secret 3,0,6,9, only 0 is common. In guess \"2708\", 0 sits at pos3 while secret has 0 in pos2, yielding 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\nFinally, check Guess 5 (\"0159\"): Its digits are 0 (pos1), 1 (pos2), 5 (pos3), 9 (pos4). In our secret:\n\u2003\u2013 9 in pos4 matches exactly \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2013 0 is in secret (pos2) but appears in guess at pos1 \u2192 cow.\nThis gives 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\nAll feedback is perfectly accounted for by secret = 3, 0, 6, 9.\n\nThus, my next guess is:\n\nGUESS: 3069"

That forces the following: \n\u2022 The secret contains exactly one digit from {3, 4} (because if it had both, guess 3478 would have yielded 2 cows) \n\u2022 And therefore the other of the two from guess 1234 must be from {1, 2}.\n\nAlso, because guess 3478 produced 1 cow and digits 7 and 8 were part of that guess, we know 7 and 8 are not in the secret. \nSo at this point the secret\u2019s digits include one of {1,2} and one of {3,4}; the other two digits will come from the remaining pool {0,5,6,9}.\n\nBefore testing the remaining digits, it\u2019s useful to isolate which candidate from {1,2} and which one from {3,4} is present. Since 7 and 8 are confirmed absent, we can use them as \u201cfillers\u201d so that only our candidate pair (one chosen digit from {1,2} and one from {3,4}) might register in our next feedback.\n\nI will try a guess that uses 1 (from {1,2}) and 3 (from {3,4}) along with 7 and 8. However, we must also remember known placement restrictions:\n\u2003\u2013 In guess 1234, digit 1 was in position 1; so if 1 is indeed in the secret, it cannot be in position 1.\n\u2003\u2013 In guess 1234, digit 3 was in position 3; if 3 is in the secret then it cannot be in position 3.\n\u2003\u2013 Also, in guess 3478, digit 3 was in position 1; so 3 cannot be in position 1 either.\nOne safe arrangement is to avoid putting 1 in position 1 and 3 in positions 1 or 3. For example, we can set:\n\u2003Position 1: 7 (filler, and we know 7\u2019s not in the secret)\n\u2003Position 2: 3 (allowed for 3)\n\u2003Position 3: 1 (allowed for 1, since 1 wasn\u2019t in position 1 in guess 1234)\n\u2003Position 4: 8 (filler)\nThus this guess is 7318.\n\nInterpreting the upcoming result:\n\u2022 If we get 2 matching digits (via bulls and/or cows) from our candidate digits (i.e. from {1,3}) then it is likely the secret uses (1,3).\n\u2022 If we get exactly 1 match then the secret\u2019s candidate pair must be either (1,4) or (2,3).\n\u2022 If we get 0 matches from {1,3} then the secret\u2019s candidate pair must be (2,4).\n\nThis will help us zero in on which candidate from {1,2} and {3,4} is correct. \nGUESS: 7318"

Since 7 and 8 are now ruled out, the cow must come from {3,4}. This tells us exactly one of {3,4} is in the secret. Consequently, the other digit among {1,2} from the first guess must be the other secret digit.\n\u2022 In 7318, you got 1 bull and 0 cows. Because 7 and 8 aren\u2019t in the secret, that bull came from either the 3 at position 2 or the 1 at position 3. Hence, we have two candidate possibilities for the elusive pair:\n\u2003 Option A: The secret contains 1 (from {1,2}) and 4 (from {3,4}) if the bull in 7318 was the 1 in position 3.\n\u2003 Option B: The secret contains 2 (from {1,2}) and 3 (from {3,4}) if the bull was the 3 in position 2.\n  \nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, I\u2019ll try a guess that tests the (1,4) pair. I\u2019ll use filler digits known to be absent (7 and 8) and insert 1 and 4 in positions that obey previous clues. Recall:\n\u2003 \u2013 In 1234, 1 was in pos1 so if 1 is in the secret it cannot be in pos1.\n\u2003 \u2013 In 1234, 4 was in pos4 so if 4 is in the secret it cannot be in pos4.\n\u2003 \u2013 In 3478, 4 was in pos2, so we should avoid that for 4.\n\nOne arrangement that meets these restrictions is to put 1 in position 2 and 4 in position 3, with 7 and 8 as fillers in positions 1 and 4. Thus, I propose the guess 7148.\n\nThe idea is: \n\u2003 \u2022 If the secret\u2019s pair is (1,4), you should see 2 matches (bulls and/or cows) from these digits.\n\u2003 \u2022 If instead the secret\u2019s candidate pair is (2,3), then neither 1 nor 4 will match, and you should get 0 matches from these positions.\n\nLet\u2019s see what feedback we get.\nGUESS: 7148"

One natural approach is to try placing candidates 6 and 5 into positions pos1 and pos3, i.e. to use the guess 6-3-5-2 (6352).\n\nConsider the outcomes:\n\u2003 \u2022 If the secret actually is Option B (i.e. Y-3-5-2 with Y \u2208 {6,9} and 5 correctly in pos3), then:\n\u2003 \u2003 \u2013 If Y happens to equal 6, then guess 6352 exactly matches the secret \u2192 you\u2019d get 4 bulls.\n\u2003 \u2003 \u2013 If Y equals 9, then in 6352 digit 6 in pos1 is wrong (and 6 isn\u2019t present anywhere), while 3, 5, and 2 (in pos2, pos3, pos4) are correct \u2192 3 bulls.\n\u2003 \u2022 On the other hand, if the secret is Option A (i.e. 0-3-X-2 with X \u2208 {6,9} and 5 is not in the secret), then:\n\u2003 \u2003 \u2013 In guess 6352, digit 6 in pos1 might match only if X equals 6? Actually, let\u2019s spell it out: \n\u2003 \u2003\u2003\u2013 pos1 in guess is 6 but secret has 0 \u2192 no bull (and 6 might be a cow only if it appears elsewhere; if secret\u2019s unknown X=6 it appears in pos3\u2014but here guess already places 6 in pos1, so that would give a cow).\n\u2003 \u2003\u2003\u2013 pos2: 3 matches in both cases.\n\u2003 \u2003\u2003\u2013 pos3: 5 is guessed but secret\u2019s unknown digit X is either 6 or 9, so 5 would be completely absent \u2192 no bull.\n\u2003 \u2003\u2003\u2013 pos4: 2 matches.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, you\u2019d see 2 bulls (from pos2 and pos4) and possibly 1 cow if digit 6 is present in secret as the unknown in pos3 (because guess\u2019s pos1 of 6 would then be a misplaced 6). That totals 2 bulls and 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2003If secret\u2019s unknown digit X = 9 instead, then guess 6352 would yield only the 2 fixed bulls.\n\nThus, the responses to 6352 would clearly distinguish a perfect match (4 bulls) or 3 bulls (likely Option B with Y=9) versus a lower bull count (Option A with a misplaced 6 or none if 6 isn\u2019t in secret).\n\nI propose we try 6352 next to see how the bull and cow counts line up.\nGUESS: 6352"

For instance, if we try 0756 as our next guess, its comparison with the possible candidates is as follows:\n\u2003\u2013 If the secret is 0756 then our guess will obviously score 4 bulls.\n\u2003\u2013 If the secret is (for example) 0675 then comparing digit\u2010by\u2010digit:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 pos1: 0 matches (bull);\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 pos2: the guess\u2019s 7 does not match the secret\u2019s 6;\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 pos3: the guess\u2019s 5 does not match the secret\u2019s 7;\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 pos4: the guess\u2019s 6 does not match the secret\u2019s 5;\n\u2003\u2003but the digits 7, 5, and 6 still occur in 0675 in different positions \u2013 yielding 1 bull and 3 cows.\n\u2003\u2013 Other candidate orders yield either 0 bulls (if none of the digits falls into the original position) or 1 bull.\nThus, the feedback on 0756 will let us distinguish one candidate outright if we get 4 bulls, or immediately rule out some orders if we get 0 bulls. Although in the case of 1 bull and 3 cows the possibilities would remain ambiguous (with two orders producing that same score), this guess is strategic: it splits the surviving set into groups that we can later separate with one additional guess.\n\nI will now use 0756 as my next guess.\n\nGUESS: 0756"

Notice that if the matching digit had been 0 (from guess 0123, which is in position 1), then 0 in our second guess also being in position 1 would have given a bull. Therefore, 0 is not in the secret. So the digit from 0123 that the secret contains must be from {1, 2, 3}.\n\u2022 Moreover, in guess 0312 the single matching digit shows up in a different position than in the original guess, which tells us that if (for example) 1 was that digit, it is not in the same position as in 0312. Recall in 0123, 1 was in the second position; if 1 is the secret digit, then secret has a 1 at position 2.\n \nFor our next guess we want to:\n1.

Any additional bull/cow information might come from whether any of the new digits 4, 5, or 7 are also present in the secret. This guess will therefore help us narrow down both the identity/position of the digit from {1,2,3} and give us insight into which of the new digits are in the secret.\n\nGUESS: 4157"

Since we already attribute the bull to 2, that extra cow indicates that exactly one digit from {6,8} is in the secret\u2014but in a different position from where we placed it in 3628 (recall: in 3628, 6 was in position\u202f2 and 8 was in position\u202f4).\n\nSo going forward we know the secret\u2019s four digits include:\n\u2022 2 (and \u2013 given our reasoning \u2013 in position 3),\n\u2022 A digit from the set {4,7} (we can narrow the candidate from {4,5,7} since 5 cannot occupy position 3, where 2 is confirmed),\n\u2022 A digit from the set {6,8}, and\n\u2022 One additional digit that has not yet appeared (we still have one \u201cslot\u201d unaccounted for that must be filled by a digit we haven\u2019t tested yet\u20149 is a likely candidate since it hasn\u2019t appeared so far).\n\nWe want our next guess to keep 2 in position 3 and to test candidates for the other three \u201cslots.\u201d Furthermore, we want to arrange the digits so that we respect what we learned about forbidden positions:\n\u2013 For the candidate from {4,7}: In 4157 the candidate digits were in positions 1 and 4 (4 at pos1 and 7 at pos4), so if the secret holds 4 then it should not be in position\u202f1, and if it holds 7 then it should not be in position\u202f4.\n\u2013 For the candidate from {6,8}: In 3628, 6 was at pos2 and 8 at pos4. So if the secret holds 6 then it should not be in pos2, and if it holds 8 then it should not be in pos4.\n\nA good way to test these now is to choose a guess that:\n\u2022 Keeps 2 in position 3.\n\u2022 Uses only one candidate from the {4,7} group (or even better, we can try a new arrangement that forces differences) and\n\u2022 Uses one candidate from {6,8} while also trying a new digit for the as\u2010yet\u2013untested slot.\n\nOne such promising guess is to try 8,4,2,9:\n\u2013 We place 2 in position\u202f3 as required.\n\u2013 We include 4 (one possibility from {4,7}) in position\u202f2. (Recall: if 4 is the secret digit, it wasn\u2019t supposed to be in pos1 as in 4157, so pos2 is acceptable.)\n\u2013 We include 8 from the {6,8} pair in position\u202f1 (if 8 is in the secret it must not appear in pos4, and here it is in pos1).\n\u2013 We introduce 9 as a new digit in position\u202f4 to test our unknown candidate.\n\nThe feedback from this guess will help us resolve:\n\u2022 If 4 is indeed the chosen candidate from {4,7} (or if the secret has 7 instead, 4 won\u2019t show up at all),\n\u2022 Which digit among {6,8} is in the secret (by how 8 fares compared to what we expect),\n\u2022 And if 9 appears, we\u2019ll know whether that \u201cnew\u201d candidate belongs.\n\u2022 And we retain the confirmed 2 in the proper slot.\n\nI\u2019ll now make this next guess.\n\nGUESS: 8429"

However, from \u201c0123\u201d we know only two of {0,1,2,3} are in the secret. This opens up two kinds of possibilities:\n\u2003\u2013 It could be that both 0 and 2 are in the secret (and the two digits from 0123 are {0,2}).\n\u2003\u2013 Or only one of 0 or 2 is in, with the other digit coming from {1, 3}.\n\nWe also gain position constraints from \u201c2405\u201d: if a digit (say 2) is in the secret, it cannot be in the same position as it was in that guess (so 2 cannot be in position 1, 4 not in pos2, 0 not in pos3, and 5 not in pos4).\n\nTo help differentiate among these possibilities and also get clues about the unknown digit (which, if we\u2019re in the case where {0,2} are our two from \u201c0123\u201d, then we know that besides 0 and 2 one more digit among {4,5} is present and the fourth digit is from the remaining ones), I will test three of the digits that appear in \u201c2405\u201d along with one new digit.

That tells us exactly two digits from {0,1,2,3} appear in the secret, one in its correct position and one not.\n\u2022 In our second guess, \u201c2405\u201d gave 0 bulls and 3 cows. Because three of these digits (2,4,0,5) appear in the secret but none in the same position, and since 5 was not in our first guess, it\u2019s more likely that the two digits from the first guess are common with \u201c2405\u201d \u2013 namely 0 and 2. In addition, exactly one of {4,5} is in the secret. (If 5 were the one, then in \u201c2416\u201d we wouldn\u2019t expect to see two hits since 5 isn\u2019t used there.) So it suggests that 4 is in the secret.\n\u2022 From \u201c2416\u201d we got 0 bulls and 2 cows. With digits 2 and 4 already strong candidates, having those two appear as cows here (with 2 in position 1 and 4 in position 2 in this guess) fits: in the secret, 2 must not be in pos1 and 4 must not be in pos2. Also, the other digits 1 and 6 in \u201c2416\u201d likely are not in the secret.\n\u2022 Tallying up, the information points to the secret containing 0, 2, and 4. From our counts we also know the secret has four unique digits, and given the feedback our \u201c2405\u201d guess yielded (exactly three of its digits are present), the remaining digit must be one we haven\u2019t tested yet. Since we can rule out 1, 3, 5, and 6 from earlier guesses, it is plausible that the unknown digit is one of {7,8,9}.\n\nWe also have some positional restrictions:\n\u2003\u2013 From \u201c2405\u201d: digit 2 (in pos1) cannot be at pos1 in the secret; 0 (in pos3) cannot be at pos3; 4 (in pos2) cannot be at pos2.\n\u2003\u2013 From \u201c0123\u201d: whichever of 0 or 2 is the bull, must appear in the same position as guessed in \u201c0123\u201d (either 0 in pos1 or 2 in pos3), and the other (appearing as cow) must not be in its guess\u2010position.\n\nA good next guess is to include our three likely digits (0,2,4) plus one candidate from the new set (we choose 7 as a test candidate) and arrange them so that we respect the above restrictions. One promising arrangement is to try 7 in the first position (no previous position restrictions), 0 in the second, 4 in the third, and 2 in the fourth. This gives:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 in pos4 (acceptable, since 2 just must avoid pos1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 4 in pos3 (acceptable, avoiding pos2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 in pos2 (acceptable, as 0 must avoid pos3)\n\nThis guess \u201c7042\u201d will not only use our deduced digits but also test whether 7 is indeed the unknown digit in the secret. The bulls and cows response to this will help us nail down the correct positions.\n\nGUESS: 7042"

For example, if 3 is exactly in its guessed position (position 4) and 2 is present but in another position, that produces 1 bull (for the 3) and 1 cow (for the 2).\n\n\u2022 Guess 2 (\u201c2405\u201d) returned 0 bulls and 3 cows. The digits in \u201c2405\u201d are {2,4,0,5} and with our candidate {4,2,5,3} the common digits are {2,4,5}.

The digits in \u201c7042\u201d are {7,0,4,2}; with our candidate the common digits are exactly {4,2}.

That is, the secret number is a derangement of 4, 2, 5, 3 with respect to \"4253\".\n\nLet\u2019s denote the secret as positions a b c d.

Its digits are 0, 1, 2, 3. Since only 2 and 3 are among {4,2,5,3}, exactly one of these must be in the same position as in \"0123\" (the bull) and the other in a different position (the cow). Because \"0123\" places 2 in position 3 and 3 in position 4, there are two scenarios:\n\u2003Option A: 2 is the bull (secret pos3 = 2) and 3 is the cow (so secret pos4 \u2260 3), or\n\u2003Option B: 3 is the bull (secret pos4 = 3) and 2 is the cow (secret pos3 \u2260 2).\n\nHowever, Option B would force secret pos4 = 3, which is forbidden by the \"4253\" clue (d \u2260 3). Thus we must have Option A: secret pos3 = 2; and 3 appears somewhere but not in pos4.\n\nNow, from our guess \"2405\" (0 bulls, 3 cows) the common digits with the secret are 2, 4, and 5, imposing additional restrictions:\n\u2003\u2022 In \"2405\" digit 2 is in pos1, so secret pos1 \u2260 2 (already satisfied if we fix pos3=2).\n\u2003\u2022 Digit 4 is in pos2, so secret pos2 \u2260 4.\n\u2003\u2022 Digit 5 is in pos4, so secret pos4 \u2260 5.\n\nLet\u2019s piece together what we have now:\n\u2003\u2022 The secret must be a permutation of {2,4,5,3} with pos3 fixed as 2.\n\u2003\u2022 From \"4253\": a \u2260 4, b \u2260 2, c = 2 (fixed), d \u2260 3.\n\u2003\u2022 From \"2405\": a \u2260 2 (fine), b \u2260 4, d \u2260 5.\n\nSince secret\u2019s digits are {2,4,5,3} and pos3 = 2, the remaining three positions get {4,5,3}.\nConsider the placement for digit 4. From \"4253\", a \u2260 4 and from \"2405\", b \u2260 4, so 4 must go to position d.\nThus, we have:\n\u2003Position 3: 2\n\u2003Position 4: 4\nNow the remaining digits {5,3} need to go to positions a and b. Also, note from \"4253\" that d \u2260 3 (consistent since we placed 4 there).\nSo there are two possibilities:\n\u2003Candidate 1: a = 5, b = 3, c = 2, d = 4\u2003(i.e. 5324)\n\u2003Candidate 2: a = 3, b = 5, c = 2, d = 4\u2003(i.e. 3524)\n\nChecking these candidates against \"0123\":\n\u2003For Candidate 1 (5324):\n\u2003\u2003\"0123\": common digits are {2,3}. In 5324 digit 2 is in pos3 and digit 3 is in pos2. \"0123\" has 2 in pos3 and 3 in pos4, so we get a bull from digit 2 and a cow from digit 3.\n\u2003For Candidate 2 (3524):\n\u2003\u2003\"0123\": here digit 2 is in pos3 (bull) and 3 is in pos1 while in guess \"0123\" digit 3 is in pos4, again 1 bull and 1 cow.\nBoth possibilities satisfy all constraints of previous feedback.\n\nTo differentiate, I will now try one of these candidates.

Notice that if the secret is 7,2,8,9 then guessing 7,2,8,9 will give 4 bulls (an immediate win), but if instead the secret were 9,2,7,8 our guess would yield a very different feedback (specifically, only 1 bull and 3 cows). \n\nThus, my next guess is 7289.\n\nGUESS: 7289"

That tells us exactly one digit among 0, 1, 2, and 3 appears in the secret number and, importantly, it is not in the same position as we placed it in 0123.\n\nIn our second guess (4256) we got 1 bull and 0 cows. This means exactly one digit among 4, 2, 5, and 6 appears\u2014and it is correctly placed\u2014while the other three digits are not in the secret number at all.\n\nIn our third guess (7218) we ended with 2 bulls and 1 cow. And in our fourth guess (7289) we got 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\nOne strong candidate interpretation is to suspect that the bull from guess2 is not 4,5, or 6 but 2 in position 2. However, pursuing that line ran into difficulties matching the guess4 feedback. This suggests trying a different possibility: let the bull from guess2 be provided by another digit.\n\nFor example, suppose the bull from guess2 is from digit 6 in position 4. Then from guess2 the secret contains 6 in pos4 and none of 4,2,5 are present. Now consider guess1 (0123). It must provide exactly one correct digit from {0,1,2,3}. Since 2 is now ruled out by guess2, the only candidate from guess1 is either 0, 1, or 3.  \n  \nNow, look at guess3 (7218) which returned 2 bulls and 1 cow. With 6 fixed in pos4, we want to set the secret in a way that (a) exactly one digit from 0123 appears (that's our digit from guess1) and (b) guess3\u2019s digits line up correctly. A candidate that works is to have the secret include 7, 8, and 1 along with the 6 already in pos4. But note the digit from guess1 must be exactly one; 1 appears in guess1. We must be careful with positions so that in guess1 the matching digit is not in the same position as the secret.\n\nConsider the candidate secret: 7,8,1,6 arranged as follows:\n  \n\u2003\u2003Secret: Position 1 = 7, Position 2 = 8, Position 3 = 1, Position 4 = 6.\n  \nCheck against each guess:\n  \n\u2022 Guess1: 0123  \n\u2003 Secret = 7,8,1,6; common digit is 1. In guess1, 1 is in position 2 while in the secret 1 is in position 3. That gives 0 bulls and 1 cow (correct).\n  \n\u2022 Guess2: 4256  \n\u2003 Compare with secret 7,8,1,6; only digit 6 appears\u2014in position 4 in both. That\u2019s 1 bull and 0 cows (correct). Also, digits 4,2,5 do not appear.\n  \n\u2022 Guess3: 7218  \n\u2003 Compare with secret 7,8,1,6:  \n\u2003\u2003 Position 1: guess has 7 and secret has 7 \u2192 bull.  \n\u2003\u2003 Position 2: guess has 2, which is not in the secret.  \n\u2003\u2003 Position 3: guess has 1 and secret has 1 \u2192 bull.  \n\u2003\u2003 Position 4: guess has 8 while the secret\u2019s 8 is in position 2 \u2192 cow.  \n\u2003This yields 2 bulls and 1 cow (correct).\n  \n\u2022 Guess4: 7289  \n\u2003 Compare with secret 7,8,1,6:  \n\u2003\u2003 Position 1: guess has 7 and secret has 7 \u2192 bull.  \n\u2003\u2003 Position 2: guess has 2, which is not in the secret.  \n\u2003\u2003 Position 3: guess has 8, but secret\u2019s 8 is in position 2 \u2192 cow.  \n\u2003\u2003 Position 4: guess has 9, which is not in the secret.  \n\u2003This yields 1 bull and 1 cow (correct).\n\nEvery response now perfectly matches the candidate secret 7816.

If both 0 and 1 were in the secret and in those same positions, they would have both shown as bulls. Since each guess only produced one bull, at most one of 0 and 1 is correct in its original position. (It could be that neither is in the secret, with the correct digits coming from the other numbers, but we must consider all possibilities.)\n\nAlso, from Guess 1 the total correct digits among {0,1,2,3} is 2 and from Guess 2 the total correct among {0,1,7,8} is 2. Write that as:\n\u2003\u2003|secret \u2229 {0,1,2,3}| = 2 \n\u2003\u2003|secret \u2229 {0,1,7,8}| = 2.\nLet X = secret \u2229 {0,1}, Y = secret \u2229 {2,3}, and Z = secret \u2229 {7,8}.

To start distinguishing these cases, a useful step is to \u201cswap\u201d the positions of 0 and 1 in our next guess.

        "content": "We can use our previous information from the three guesses together. Let\u2019s summarize what the clues tell us so far. In our three guesses we noted the following (each guess totaled 2 correct digits, counting both bulls and cows):\n\n\u2022 Guess 1 (0123):  0, 1, 2, 3 contributed 2 digits to the secret.\n\u2022 Guess 2 (0178):  0, 1, 7, 8 contributed 2 digits to the secret.\n\u2022 Guess 3 (1038):  1, 0, 3, 8 contributed 2 digits to the secret.\n\nNotice that the two digits 0 and 1 appear in all three guesses. By comparing the guesses we can deduce a few relationships. In particular, because Guess 1 gives (from {0,1,2,3}) 2 correct digits and Guess 3 (from {0,1,3,8}) again gives 2, the contributions coming from the pairs {2,3} and {3,8} must be in balance. In fact, by comparing the equations we get:\n\u2003\u2003(Number of secret digits from {0,1}) + I(2) + I(3) = 2\u2003\u2003\u2003(from Guess 1)\n\u2003\u2003(Number of secret digits from {0,1}) + I(7) + I(8) = 2\u2003\u2003\u2003(from Guess 2)\n\u2003\u2003(Number of secret digits from {0,1}) + I(3) + I(8) = 2\u2003\u2003\u2003(from Guess 3)\n\nSubtracting these equations gives us I(2) = I(8) and I(7) = I(3). In other words, either both 2 and 8 are in the secret or neither is, and either both 3 and 7 are in the secret or neither is. (Also, it might be that one digit among 0 and 1 is in the secret, or possibly both \u2013 we call that count r.) So it appears that our results could fall into one of several scenarios:\n\n1. It could be that neither 0 nor 1 are in the secret (r = 0). Then Guess 1 forces both 2 and 3 to be \u201cin\u201d and Guess 2 forces both 7 and 8 to be \u201cin.\u201d The secret would consist exactly of the four digits {2, 3, 7, 8} (in some order).\n2. It might be that exactly one of 0 and 1 is in the secret (r = 1). Then exactly one digit comes from the pair {2,3} (and thus neither from the other pair) and exactly one digit comes from the pair {7,8} \u2013 leaving one more digit (a new one that we haven\u2019t yet tested) as part of the secret.\n3. Alternatively, it could be that both 0 and 1 are in the secret (r = 2). Then neither any digit from {2,3} nor from {7,8} would be in the secret.\n\nTo help decide among these, it\u2019s useful to test a guess that puts the two candidate pairs fully on the table. If we choose a guess that uses the digits 2, 3, 7, and 8 (i.e. \u201c2378\u201d), we see the following:\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret is {2,3,7,8} (Scenario 1), all four digits are correct (though possibly in the wrong order), meaning the bulls+cows sum would be 4.\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret comes from Scenario 2 (one of {0,1} plus one digit from {2,3} and one from {7,8} plus another new digit), then exactly 2 of the digits 2,3,7,8 will appear in the secret.\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret comes from Scenario 3 (both 0 and 1 and two other unknown digits), then none of the digits 2,3,7,8 would be in the secret.\nThus, the guess \u201c2378\u201d should provide a clear signal: a total of 4 correct digits means we have the secret (though still possibly jumbled), 2 means we\u2019re in one of the mixed cases, and 0 means neither candidate pair is present.\n\nI\u2019ll now use \u201c2378\u201d as my next guess.\nGUESS: 2378"

Here\u2019s a summary of what we know:\n\n\u2022 From Guess 1 (1234, 0 bulls, 1 cow): Exactly one digit from {1,2,3,4} is in the secret number. That candidate is 1 (since none of 2, 3, or 4 reappear later).\n\n\u2022 From Guess 2 (0567, 0 bulls, 2 cows): Exactly two digits among {0,5,6,7} are present. Later tests suggest these two are 5 and 6.\n\n\u2022 From Guess 3 (5108, 2 bulls, 1 cow): Among {5,1,0,8}, three digits occur. Given the above, these turn out to be 5, 1, and 8.\n\n\u2022 From Guess 4 (9105, 1 bull, 1 cow): Comparing {9,1,0,5} with what we know (which now is {1,5,? ,?}) confirms that exactly the two digits from this guess belonging to our candidate set are 1 and 5, and\u2014the detail of bulls versus cows\u2014helps us nail down their positions.\n\nA consistent candidate for the secret digit set is {1, 5, 8, 6}.\n\nNow we must fix an order. In our analysis one arrangement that meets all feedback is secret = 6,1,5,8. Let\u2019s verify quickly:\n\n\u2022 For Guess 1: 1234 versus 6,1,5,8 \u2192 Only common digit is 1; in guess 1 the 1 is in position 0, while in our candidate 1 is in position 1. That gives 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2022 For Guess 2: 0567 versus 6,1,5,8 \u2192 The common digits are 6 and 5. In guess 2, 0 is in pos0, 5 in pos1, 6 in pos2, 7 in pos3. In our candidate 6,1,5,8, 6 is in pos0 (so it isn\u2019t in pos2) and 5 is in pos2 (so it isn\u2019t in pos1). That results in 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2022 For Guess 3: 5108 versus 6,1,5,8 \u2192 The common digits are 5, 1, and 8. Here 1 appears in pos1 (matching bull), 8 in pos3 (bull), and 5 is present in pos2 though guessed in pos0, so it\u2019s a cow. That yields 2 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2022 For Guess 4: 9105 versus 6,1,5,8 \u2192 The common digits are 1 and 5. In our candidate, 1 is in position 1 and 5 in position 2. In guess 4, 1 is in pos1 (bull) and 5 is in pos3 (cow). That gives 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\nAll clues are met by secret = 6158.\n\nI will now guess 6158.\n\nGUESS: 6158"

In our Guess 5 (6158) we got 1 bull and 3 cows \u2013 meaning all four digits are in the secret number but only one is in the correct spot. Let\u2019s denote the secret as positions S0, S1, S2, S3 and work with the clues:\n\n1) From Guess 1 (1234 with 0 bulls, 1 cow), only digit 1 from {1,2,3,4} is in the secret. Since 1 was guessed at position 0 in Guess 1 and was not a bull, 1 cannot be S0.\n\n2) From Guess 2 (0567 with 0 bulls, 2 cows), the two matching digits from {0,5,6,7} are 5 and 6. In that guess, 5 was in position 1 and 6 in position 2, so in the secret, 5 cannot be in position 1 and 6 cannot be in position 2.\n\n3) From Guess 4 (9105 with 1 bull, 1 cow), the only matching digits from our set are 1 and 5 (since 9 and 0 are not in {6,1,5,8}). This tells us that either:\n\u2003\u2022 Option A: 1 is a bull (in position 1, as guessed in Guess 4) and then 5 is a cow (so 5 \u2260 S3), or\n\u2003\u2022 Option B: 5 is a bull (in position 3) and then 1 is a cow (so 1 \u2260 S1).\nWe test Option A first.\n\nNow, consider Guess 3 (5108 with 2 bulls, 1 cow). Its matching digits with our set are 5, 1, and 8. With Option A from Guess 4 (setting S1 = 1), we can see in Guess 3:\n\u2003\u2013 Position 1 is 1 which gives a bull.\nWe need one more bull among digits 5 and 8. Let\u2019s set S0 = 5 (so that Guess 3\u2019s pos0 is a bull) and then the remaining digits 8 and 6 fill positions S2 and S3 (with S3 \u2260 8 in Guess 3 to count 8 as a cow). Placing 8 in S2 and 6 in S3 works, as:\n\u2003\u2022 In Guess 3, 8 is at pos3, and here it\u2019s in pos2 \u2192 cow.\nThen our candidate secret becomes 5-1-8-6.\n\nDouble-checking against all guesses:\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 1 (1234): Only 1 appears, and here 1 is in S1 (not pos0) \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 2 (0567): The digits 5 and 6 are present; in Guess 2, 5 was pos1 and 6 pos2. In our secret, 5 is S0 and 6 is S3 \u2192 both contribute as cows \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 3 (5108): Comparing with secret 5-1-8-6:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Guess pos0: 5 equals secret S0 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Pos1: 1 equals S1 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Pos3: 8 is in S2 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003That gives 2 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 4 (9105): The matching digits are 1 and 5. Here, 1 is at pos1 (bull) and 5 in Guess 4 is at pos3 while in secret it\u2019s at S0 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 5 (6158): Comparing with secret 5-1-8-6:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Pos0: 6 is not in S0 (6 is in S3) \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Pos1: 1 is in S1 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Pos2: 5 is in S0 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Pos3: 8 is in S2 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003That gives 1 bull, 3 cows.\n\nAll clues are satisfied by secret = 5186.\n\nTherefore, my next guess is 5186.\n\nGUESS: 5186"

That means three of the digits 4, 0, 5, and 7 are correct and in the correct positions, while one of these four is not in the secret number at all.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the positions as follows for guess 4057:\n\u2003Position 1: 4\n\u2003Position 2: 0\n\u2003Position 3: 5\n\u2003Position 4: 7\n\nOne of these digits is wrong.

Note that 0 appears in guess 4057. So if 0 is that digit, its placement might be confirmed. If not, then one of 1, 2, or 3 must appear in the secret, and it currently isn\u2019t among the confirmed digits from guess 4057.\n\nTo help us distinguish which digit from 4057 is the odd one out\u2014and to check for the possibility of a candidate from {1, 2, 3} that may be the secret digit from guess 0123\u2014I\u2019ll change the digit in position 1 (currently 4) to 1.

When we swapped the digit in position 1 (changing 4 to 1) for 1057, we still got 3 bulls, which implies that position 1\u2019s digit from both guesses (4 and 1) was not correct, and that the bulls in both cases come from the digits in positions 2, 3, and 4.

In that case the secret would contain 0, 4, 5 plus a fourth digit that is not among 4, 5, 6, 7 (to preserve the counts in Guess 2 and Guess 3). Alternatively, the secret might have two digits common to both sets plus one different digit from {6,7} coming in from one of the guesses. For example, one possibility is that the secret is comprised of {0,4,6,7} or {0,5,6,7}. Notice that all our candidate possibilities always include 0 (from Guess 1).\n\nTo try to distinguish these candidate sets, I want a guess that touches on the conflicting parts:\n\u2003\u2013 Option A (from the first possibility) would include {0,4,5} along with an extra digit that is neither 6 nor 7.\n\u2003\u2013 The other options bring in both 6 and 7 (with either 4 or 5 missing).\n\nA good strategy is to test a guess that uses 0 (which we believe is in the secret), and includes both 6 and 7. Then, by including one of 4 or 5, the feedback will tell us more:\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret does not include 6 and 7 (as in Option A) we\u2019d expect only 0 and whichever of 4 or 5 you include to be hits (2 matches).\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret is {0,4,6,7} then a guess including all four digits (0,4,6,7) will match all 4.\n\u2003\u2022 And if the secret is {0,5,6,7}, then using 0,6,7, plus 4 (which is the wrong one in that set) should produce 3 matches.\n\nI\u2019ll arrange the guess as 6074. This guess will clearly differentiate among the candidate sets:\n\u2003\u2013 If we get 2 matches, it suggests the secret is missing both 6 and 7 (pointing toward a set like {0,4,5,X} with X being a digit other than 6 or 7),\n\u2003\u2013 A feedback of 4 indicates that 0, 6, 7, and 4 are exactly the secret\u2019s digits,\n\u2003\u2013 And 3 matches would indicate that the secret likely is {0,5,6,7} (since in that case 4 is not in the secret).\n\nI\u2019ll go with 6074 as the next guess.\n\nGUESS: 6074"

Also, to account for Guess 4\u2019s 1 bull, one convenient option is to put the digit 4 in position 4 (since Guess 4\u2019s position 4 is 4) and then place 0 and 5 in positions 1\u20133 so that neither appears in a position that gives an extra bull in Guess 4. A candidate ordering then is: \n\u2003\u2003Position 1: unknown digit X (to be determined) \n\u2003\u2003Position 2: 5 \n\u2003\u2003Position 3: 0 \n\u2003\u2003Position 4: 4\n\nNow check a few things:\n\u2013 With secret = (X,5,0,4), Guess 2 (4560: positions 1=4, 2=5, 3=6, 4=0) gives: \n\u2003\u2022 5 in position 2 gives a bull, \n\u2003\u2022 4 appears in secret at pos4 (matching guess pos1) and 0 appears in secret at pos3 (matching guess pos4) so that produces 2 cows. \nTotal: 1 bull, 2 cows.\n\u2013 Guess 3 (4057: positions 1=4, 2=0, 3=5, 4=7) then has the digits 4,0,5 all present but in different spots (none in the same positions as in guess 3) so we have 0 bulls and 3 cows.\n\u2013 And Guess 4 (6074: positions 1=6, 2=0, 3=7, 4=4) gets: 4 is in secret position 4 (bull) while 0 (in secret position 3) is found in guess position 2, so 1 cow. \n\u2013 Finally, Guess 1 (0123) matches only 0 from secret (secret has 0 in pos3 while guess1 has 0 in pos1) so that yields 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\nThis arrangement forces the \u201cmystery\u201d digit X (the first position) to be something other than 0,4,5 and also not one of {1,2,3,6,7} (to keep Guess 1\u2019s intersection unique and not disturb the other counts). That leaves possibilities such as 8 or 9 (or perhaps others >7, but 8 and 9 are our only remaining options).\n\nTo test this idea, I\u2019ll try a candidate guess that assigns X = 8. That is, I\u2019ll guess 8 in position 1 while keeping our positions for 5, 0, and 4 as deduced, i.e. (8, 5, 0, 4). The feedback on 8504 should tell us whether the mystery digit is 8 (or not\u2014in which case 9 becomes a likely choice).\n\nGUESS: 8504"

I\u2019ll pick \u201c1\u201d from the first group, \u201c4\u201d and \u201c5\u201d from the second group, and \u201c8\u201d from the third group.\n\nWe must also rearrange these digits so that none appears in a position where it was before if it was already used in a previous guess.

        "content": "Let's summarize what we\u2019ve learned so far:\n\n\u2022 From guess 0123 (0 bulls, 1 cow), we know that exactly one digit from {0,1,2,3} is in the secret number.\n\u2022 From guess 4567 (0 bulls, 2 cows), we know that exactly two digits from {4,5,6,7} are in the secret.\n\u2022 From guess 1485 (1 bull, 0 cows), we see that among the digits 1, 4, 8, and 5, exactly one is correct and in its proper place while the other three are not in the secret at all.\n\nOne scenario is that the unique digit from {0,1,2,3} is 1 (making it the bull in guess 1485 when placed in position 1) and then neither 4, 8 nor 5 appear; this would force the two digits from {4,5,6,7} (required by guess 4567) to come from {6,7} and the remaining digit would be from {8,9} (in this case likely 9 because 8 was ruled out in guess 1485). Another is that the bull in guess 1485 comes from 4 (if placed in its position) meaning 4 is correct and 1, 5, and 8 are not in the secret. In that case the unique digit from {0,1,2,3} must be one of the others (0, 2, or 3), and the two from {4,5,6,7} would be 4 and one of {6,7} while the extra digit comes from {8,9} (with 8 eliminated by guess 1485 again, forcing 9).\n\nTo help distinguish between these possibilities, it is useful to include candidates from the disputed groups. Notice that possibility 1 involves 1 as the digit from {0,1,2,3} while possibility 2 would supply a digit different from 1 (say 0, 2, or 3) and include 4 as a confirmed digit from {4,5,6,7}. My next guess will include both 1 and 4 along with 7 (a candidate from {4,5,6,7} that hasn\u2019t been locked in by previous positioning) and 9 (our likely candidate from {8,9}).\n\nI will choose a guess that uses these four digits but places them in positions different from any earlier guess (recall: in guess 0123 digit1 was 0, digit2 was 1, etc., and in guess 1485 1 was in pos1 and 4 in pos2). One viable ordering is: 2 in pos1, 1 in pos2, 7 in pos3, and 9 in pos4. Here 2 is from {0,1,2,3} (testing if the secret\u2019s unique digit is 1 or perhaps something else) and we keep 1 and 4 separated because we are checking whether the secret contains 1 (possibility 1) or not. Although we do not include 4 directly in this ordering, note that our previous guess already involved 4; by introducing 2 as the option from {0,1,2,3} we force a difference: if the secret has 1 (possibility 1) then neither 2 nor the already-eliminated 4 from guess 1485 will count, whereas if the secret\u2019s candidate from {0,1,2,3} is 2 then this guess will pick it up.\n\nOn second thought, to directly test for the presence of 1 versus another candidate from {0,1,2,3} (and recalling guess 1485 already suggests that either 1 or 4 is the bull), it is beneficial to include both 1 and 4 in the next guess. So I will refine the approach: let\u2019s use the four digits \u201c2, 1, 7, 9\u201d so that we include 1 (our possibility 1 candidate) and also have 2 from the same group {0,1,2,3} to check if the secret might have a candidate other than 1. (Remember: only one digit from {0,1,2,3} is in the secret.) \n\nI choose the guess 2179 with the following reasoning:\n\u2013 If the secret has 1 (possibility 1), then 1 (from pos2) plus 7 and 9 (if they come from {4,5,6,7} and {8,9}) will show up.\n\u2013 If instead the secret uses a candidate from {0,1,2,3} other than 1 (say 2) and contains 4 (from the previous test) with one digit from {4,5,6,7} among 7, then our feedback will differ.\nComparing the response (in terms of number of hits among these four candidates) should help us narrow which scenario is emerging.\n\nThus, I\u2019ll use 2179 as my next guess.\n\nGUESS: 2179"

Furthermore, the feedback from 1485 (1 bull, 0 cows) forces one of its digits to be correct and in the proper position while eliminating the other three. If that bull is the 4 in the second position, then the secret contains 4 in position 2. In that case the one digit from {0,1,2,3} cannot be 1 (because 1 would have been \u201cactive\u201d in 1485), so it must be from {0,2,3}. Also, from 4567 we deduce that the two correct digits from {4,5,6,7} must be 4 (which we now know sits in position 2) and the other digit must come from either 6 or 7 (since 5 is \u201cruled out\u201d by 1485). Finally, with eight digits already tested (0123 and 4567) and only three confirmed digits overall (one from group A and two from group B) the missing digit must come from outside these eight, namely from {8,9}. And since 8 was in 1485 and did not contribute to a cow, the extra digit must be 9.\n\nThat leaves the following candidate pool for the secret:\n\u2013 One digit from group A: one of {0,2,3} \n\u2013 Two digits from group B: confirmed 4 (in position 2) and the second one is either 6 or 7 \n\u2013 One digit from group C: 9\n\nIn our previous guess 2179 the intersection with the secret gave 2 cows. For instance, if the secret were {2,4,6,9} (with group A = 2 and group B\u2019s second digit = 6) then the digits 2 and 9 would be the ones from 2179. On the other hand, if the secret were {0,4,7,9} (or {3,4,7,9}) then in 2179 only 7 and 9 would be common.\n\nTo distinguish these possibilities, I\u2019m going to test the specific discriminators by using a guess that includes 2 and 6 as candidates versus 0/3 and 7. I already expect that 4 is correct and belongs in position 2, and 9 is also in the secret but (from 2179) cannot be in position 4 because that guess yielded no bull when 9 was in pos4. So, I propose arranging our new guess as follows:\n\u2022 Put 4 in position 2.\n\u2022 Place 9 in position 1 (since 9 cannot be in pos4 per previous 2179).\n\u2022 Then use 2 (the option from {0,2,3}) in position 3 and 6 (the possibility in {6,7}) in position 4.\nThat gives the guess 9-4-2-6, i.e. 9426.\n\nNow let\u2019s see how it would work in our two main candidate cases:\n\u2022 If the secret is {2,4,6,9} (say, arranged as 6,4,9,2), then:\n\u2003\u2013 4 in pos2 will be a bull.\n\u2003\u2013 The 9, 2, and 6 will all be present but in different positions, likely producing 3 cows.\n\u2003Resulting feedback: 1 bull, 3 cows.\n\u2022 If the secret is {0,4,7,9} (say, 7,4,0,9), then:\n\u2003\u2013 4 in pos2 will be a bull.\n\u2003\u2013 Of the remaining digits, only 9 is common (2 and 6 are not in secret), so we\u2019d get 1 additional cow.\n\u2003Resulting feedback: 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\nThus, the feedback from 9426 will let us discern whether the secret\u2019s group A candidate is 2 with a 6 from group B or from the alternative (with no 2 and 6).\nI will now propose 9426 as the next guess.\n\nGUESS: 9426"

In our elimination process, it appears that the only viable candidate from this group is 0.\n2. Exactly two digits from {4,5,6,7} are in the secret. The information from guess 1485 (which gave 1 bull using one digit from {1,4,8,5}) forces that bull to be 4 (since using 1 would force 1 into the {0,1,2,3} group and conflict with other clues). With 4 locked in, the other Group\u2011B digit must be 7 (since in other guesses the only way to obtain the 2 cows or 2 common digits is by having both 4 and 7 among the guess digits).\n3. Exactly one digit from {8,9} is in the secret. Since 8 showed up in guess 1485 with no response, that digit is not present so the digit must be 9.\n\nThus, the secret\u2019s four digits are deduced to be 0, 4, 7, and 9. The position information we\u2019ve gleaned is very telling:\n\u2013 Guess 1485\u2019s 1 bull tells us 4 is in the correct spot; since in guess 1485 the 4 was in the second position, we infer secret\u2019s pos2 = 4.\n\u2013 Guess 2179 (digits 2,1,7,9) returned 0 bulls but 2 cows; these two cows must come from 7 and 9 being present but in positions different from 7 in pos3 and 9 in pos4.\n\u2013 Guess 9426 (digits 9,4,2,6) gave 1 bull and 1 cow. With the bull coming from 4 being in pos2, the cow must come from 9 (which in guess 9426 is in pos1) being present elsewhere.\n\u2013 Finally, the only digit left for Group A is 0 and it did not appear as a bull in the guess 0123, so it must occupy neither pos1 (where 0 was in 0123) nor any guess position that would contradict previous feedback.\n\nA candidate ordering that satisfies all known constraints is to choose the secret as 7,4,9,0.

In guess 4567 the 7 is in pos4 and 4 is in pos1, while in secret they are in pos1 and pos2 \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2022 Against 1485: Only 4 is common, and in both guess\u2019s pos2 and secret\u2019s pos2 \u2192 1 bull, 0 cows.\n\u2022 Against 2179: The common digits are 7 and 9. In guess 2179 the 7 is at pos3 and 9 at pos4; in secret, 7 is at pos1 and 9 at pos3. So none match in position \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2022 Against 9426: The common digits are 9 and 4.

This tells us that exactly one digit among {0,1,2,3} is in the secret, but not in the position it was guessed.\n\n\u2022 Guess 4567 (digits: 4, 5, 6, 7) gave 0 bulls and 2 cows. Therefore exactly two digits among {4,5,6,7} are in the secret, and neither is in the guessed position.\n\n\u2022 Guess 1485 (digits: 1, 4, 8, 5) returned 1 bull and 0 cows. This means exactly one of these digits is in the secret and is in the exact position shown; the other three are absent.\n\n\u2022 Guess 2179 (digits: 2, 1, 7, 9) had 0 bulls and 2 cows. So exactly two of these digits appear in the secret, but in different positions.\n\n\u2022 Guess 9426 (digits: 9, 4, 2, 6) resulted in 1 bull and 1 cow. Thus two of these digits appear in the secret, one exactly placed and one in a different position.\n\n\u2022 Finally, Guess 7490 (digits: 7, 4, 9, 0) produced 1 bull and 0 cows. This tells us that exactly one digit among these is in the secret and exactly in the same position as in 7490; the other three digits do not appear in the secret at all.\n\nA promising way to explain the combined clues is as follows (one consistent possibility):\n\n1. From Guess 1485, let the bull be the digit 8 in position 3. Then S3 = 8 and digits 1, 4, and 5 are eliminated from the secret.\n\n2. From Guess 4567 we then must get our two correct group\u2011B digits from {4, 5, 6, 7}. With 4 and 5 eliminated, both digits must be chosen from {6, 7}. So S includes 6 and 7.\n\n3. From Guess 0123, exactly one digit from {0,1,2,3} is present. With 1 eliminated, the candidate from this set must be either 0, 2, or 3. Later clues (especially Guess 9426 and 2179) point toward 2 being present.\n\n4. Group C (digits {8,9}) must contribute exactly one digit. Since we already fixed 8 in S3, 9 is not in the secret.\n\n5. Now look at Guess 7490. Its digits are 7 (pos1), 4 (pos2), 9 (pos3), 0 (pos4) and it gave 1 bull, 0 cows. Since 4 and 9 are already eliminated and 0 is not our candidate from group A (because we lean toward 2), the only possibility is that 7 appears exactly in its guessed place. In Guess 7490, 7 is in position 1, so we set S1 = 7.\n\n6. We now have determined S1 = 7 and S3 = 8. The remaining two positions must be filled with the digit 2 from group A and the remaining group\u2011B digit 6 (since our group\u2011B digits are {6,7} and we already used 7). We must assign these to S2 and S4 so that all clues hold.\n\n7. Consider Guess 9426 (digits: 9,4,2,6, in positions 1\u20134). We need its feedback to be 1 bull and 1 cow. S already contains 7 (pos1), 2, 8, 6; from the guess, only 2 and 6 appear. If we assign S2 = 2 and S4 = 6 then in Guess 9426 the digit 2 is in position 3 (S2=2 \u2192 cow) and 6 is in position 4 with S4=6, which is a bull. This yields exactly 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\n8. Finally, check Guess 2179 (digits: 2,1,7,9): S contains 2 and 7. In this guess, 2 is at pos1 while in S 2 is at pos2 (cow) and 7 is guessed at pos3 while in S 7 is at pos1 (cow). This produces 0 bulls and 2 cows, as required.\n\nThus a consistent secret number is:\n\u2003\u2003Position 1: 7\n\u2003\u2003Position 2: 2\n\u2003\u2003Position 3: 8\n\u2003\u2003Position 4: 6\n\nEvery previous guess matches its reported bulls and cows with S = 7 2 8 6.\n\nI'll now make the next guess as 7286.\n\nGUESS: 7286"

Notice that digit 0 is common to guess 1, so if 0 is in the secret then it\u2019s our one candidate from {0,1,2,3} and from guess 2 exactly one more digit is among {4,5,6}.\n\u2022 Guess 3 (0789) gave 1 bull and 2 cows. Its digits are {0, 7, 8, 9}. This tells us that 3 of these digits are in the secret. Again, if 0 is in the secret then the remaining two matches must come from {7,8,9}.\n\nAssuming 0 is indeed the common digit (the one from {0,1,2,3}), then the secret consists of:\n\u2003\u2013 0,\n\u2003\u2013 exactly one digit from {4,5,6}, and \n\u2003\u2013 exactly two digits from {7,8,9}.\n\nA candidate fitting these conditions is 7,4,8,0 arranged so the bulls/cows feedback is respected:\n\u2003\u2022 In guess 1 (0123): Only 0 is present; since guess 1 puts 0 in position 1 but here we assign 0 to a different position (position 4), it contributes 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2022 In guess 2 (4560): The digit 0 is at position 4 in both the guess and candidate (bull) and digit 4 is present but in a different position (cow). That gives exactly 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2022 In guess 3 (0789): The candidate contains 0, 7, and 8 from this guess. For instance, if we assign secret = 7 (pos1), 4 (pos2), 8 (pos3), 0 (pos4): in guess 3 the digit 8 in position 3 is a bull (matching secret\u2019s pos3) while 0 and 7 are in the secret but in different positions (cows). This produces 1 bull and 2 cows.\n\nThis candidate (7480) perfectly matches all previous feedback. Therefore, my next guess is:\n\nGUESS:7480"

That means exactly two of these four digits belong somewhere in the secret number\u2014but none were in the correct position. We can assume the secret contains one digit from {0,1} and one from {2,3}.\n\n\u2022 In the second guess, 4501, we received 1 bull and 0 cows. Since 4 and 5 are new and did not score, the bull must come from the repeated digits among 0 and 1. So one of them is correct and in its correct position.\n\n\u2022 In the third guess, 1267, we again got 1 bull and 0 cows. This guess included 1 and 2 from our suspect set. It cannot be that both are in the secret because that would yield either 2 bulls (if both were in the right positions) or at least a cow if one was right but in the wrong place. Thus exactly one of these is present\u2014and in the correct position in this guess.\n\nIf we take the bull from 1267 to be from digit 2 in position 2, then digit 1 would be absent. That works with the previous result from 4501: it would then mean the bull there came from 0 (which then must be at its position in that guess, position 3). Let\u2019s see if that is consistent with our other feedback:\n\u2003\u2013 In 0123, if the secret contains 0 and 2, then 0 (guessed at pos1) and 2 (guessed at pos3) would both be cows\u2014which fits the 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2013 In 4501, digit 0 appears now in position 3, which would be the bull; the others (4,5, and 1) would be absent.\n\u2003\u2013 In 1267, digit 2 is in position2. For it to score a bull, the secret must have 2 in position2. And since neither 1, 6, nor 7 are in the secret, we get exactly 1 bull.\n\nSo far the secret must include 0 and 2, with 0 correctly placed in position3 and 2 correctly placed in position2, meaning:\n\u2003\u2013 Position2 = 2, Position3 = 0.\nAlso from the first guess, the other candidate (from {0,1} and {2,3}) is now fully determined: from {0,1} we use 0 and from {2,3} we use 2. This leaves the remaining two digits in the 4-digit secret to come from digits that haven\u2019t been tested in our main cluster. Notice that digits 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 appear to be eliminated from our deductions.\n\nThat leaves only the possibilities 8 and 9 for the remaining two positions (positions1 and 4). We still need to decide their order. Since we haven\u2019t gotten any contradictory clues regarding 8 and 9, we can try one arrangement.\n\nI will try the guess with:\n\u2003\u2013 Position1 = 8\n\u2003\u2013 Position2 = 2\n\u2003\u2013 Position3 = 0\n\u2003\u2013 Position4 = 9\n\nThis guess is 8209.

        "content": "Let\u2019s summarize the situation from our previous guesses:\n\n\u2022 In guess 0123 we got 0 bulls and 2 cows. That means exactly two digits among 0, 1, 2, 3 are in the secret number (but in different positions than in 0123).\n\n\u2022 In guess 4501 we got 1 bull and 0 cows. Because 4 and 5 are new and likely ruled out, the bull must come from 0 or 1. (The other digit from that guess did not appear at all.)\n\n\u2022 In guess 1267 we got 1 bull and 0 cows. That guess tells us that exactly one digit among 1, 2, 6, 7 is in the secret and in its correct position\u2014and the others don\u2019t occur. (So among 1 and 2\u2014digits also from 0123\u2014only one is in the secret, and 6 and 7 are out in that respect, unless one of them becomes our \u201cbull candidate\u201d in a specific case.)\n\n\u2022 In guess 8209 we got 1 bull and 1 cow. Its digits (8, 2, 0, 9) share two with the pool from guess 0123 (namely 2 and 0) and introduced 8 and 9. The feedback shows that exactly 2 digits from this guess are in the secret (one in the right place and one not). \n\nA particularly promising line of reasoning is to assume that the bull in guess 1267 comes from the last position (D) with digit 7. Then secret D = 7 and, by that guess\u2019s \u201cno cows\u201d clause, the other digits in 1267 (i.e. 1, 2, 6) do not occur anywhere. Then from guess 0123 (which must have exactly 2 correct digits from {0,1,2,3}) only 0 and 3 remain possible. That forces the secret to use both 0 and 3. Next, look at guess 4501. Its digits are 4, 5, 0, 1. With 1 ruled out (and 4,5 not showing up earlier) the only candidate is 0, and for guess 4501 to yield 1 bull (and no cows) 0 must be exactly in the same (third) position. In other words, secret position C must be 0. Then so far the secret uses 3 and 0 from guess 0123 plus the 7 fixed from guess 1267. (Notice that now exactly 2 digits from 0123 appear, as needed.) Finally, since no other digit from prior guesses appears, the fourth digit must come from those not yet eliminated\u2014in this scenario only 8 or 9 remain possible. Also note that our earlier guesses force the positions of 0 and 7 (C and D, respectively), and they do not contradict the guess 8209 (which, when compared to our candidate secrets, yields 1 bull and 1 cow).\n\nSo at this point the potential secret number has its third and fourth digits fixed as 0 and 7; its remaining two digits (in positions A and B) must be 3 plus either 8 or 9. In fact, we have three candidates with the fixed set {0,3,7} and one uncertain digit:\n\u2003\u2022 Possibility A: 3 in pos1 and 8 in pos2 \u2192 3807\n\u2003\u2022 Possibility B: 3 in pos1 and 9 in pos2 \u2192 3907\n\u2003\u2022 Possibility C: 9 in pos1 and 3 in pos2 \u2192 9307\n\nNow, let\u2019s see what feedback guess 8209 gives against these candidates. For example, with candidate A (3807):\n\u2003Comparing 8209 with 3807:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position A: 8 (guess) versus 3 \u2192 8 is present in candidate A (at pos2) giving a cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position B: 2 versus 8 \u2192 no match.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position C: 0 versus 0 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position D: 9 versus 7 \u2192 no match.\nThat totals 1 bull and 1 cow, matching the response.\n\nSimilar checking shows that candidates B and C would also produce 1 bull and 1 cow for guess 8209. We must now design our next guess to differentiate between these possibilities. A natural way is to \u201ctest\u201d the candidate ordering directly. If we guess 3807 and then see:\n\u2003\u2013 4 bulls, we have the answer.\n\u2003\u2013 3 bulls, this tells us that 3807 isn\u2019t exactly right but points toward the (3,9,0,7) candidates.\n\u2003\u2013 2 bulls and 1 cow, then the order likely is reversed (i.e. 9307).\n\nThus, I propose our next guess to be 3807. This will allow us to decide whether the unknown digit is an 8 or a 9 and whether its position (together with the fixed 3, 0, 7) matches exactly.\n\nGUESS: 3807"

We must be careful with placement, remembering:\n\u2003\u2022 From guess 0123, 0 (at pos0) and 2 (at pos2) were in the wrong positions.\n\u2003\u2022 From guess 2607, 0 (at pos2) and 2 (at pos0) were in wrong positions if they contributed as cows.\n\nA placement that avoids these forbidden spots is to put 0 in position 1 and 2 in position 3. We can place 6 in a spot not ruled out (for instance position 2) and use 5 in the remaining open slot (position 0). This gives the guess: 5 at pos0, 0 at pos1, 6 at pos2, and 2 at pos3.\n\nThus, our next guess is 5062.\nGUESS: 5062"

        "content": "Let\u2019s summarize what we know:\n\n\u2022 Guess 0123 (0 bulls, 2 cows) told us that exactly two of {0,1,2,3} are in the secret; none were in their guessed position.  \n\u2022 Guess 2607 (1 bull, 2 cows) showed that three of its digits (from {2,6,0,7}) are in the secret. The only digits in common with 0123 are 0 and 2, so it\u2019s likely that both 0 and 2 are in the secret \u2013 with one of {6,7} filling out the three-digit match from 2607.  \n\u2022 Guess 1367 (0 bulls, 1 cow) reinforces that neither 1 nor 3 is in the secret and that only one digit among {6,7} is in the secret. Taken together with the previous guess, it\u2019s more consistent that the secret contains 7 (and not 6).  \n\u2022 Thus, so far the likely confirmed digits are 0, 2, and 7.  \n\u2022 Guess 5062 (1 bull, 1 cow) uses 0 and 2 (along with 5 and 6) and confirms that 0 and 2 are in (the bull and cow coming from them) while 5 and 6 are absent.\n\nBecause the secret is 4-digit and digits do not repeat, one digit remains unknown. None of our guesses indicated 4, 8, or 9 so far, so the fourth digit must be one of the as\u2010yet-untested digits (and certainly not one of 1,3,5,6 from our previous feedback).\n\nOur deductions lead us to believe the secret is composed of {0,2,7} plus one unknown digit (likely from {4,8,9}). We also know from previous feedback that:\n\u2003\u2013 In 0123 the bull \u201cmismatches\u201d tell us that 0 and 2 are not in the positions guessed there (i.e. 0 isn\u2019t at pos0 and 2 isn\u2019t at pos2).  \n\u2003\u2013 In 1367, 7 was guessed in pos3 and did not result in a bull, so 7 is not in position 3.\n\nOne plausible positioning to consider (compatible with all previous clues) is putting 0 in position 2 and 2 in position 3 (which agrees with 0123\u2019s result) and placing 7 in one of the earlier positions (not pos3). The remaining unknown digit, let\u2019s test with 4, can be tried in the remaining spot.\n\nFor instance, consider the candidate secret 7,4,0,2:\n\u2003\u2022 Compare with 0123: 0 is in pos2 (guest was pos0) and 2 is in pos3 (guest was pos2) \u2192 2 cows.  \n\u2003\u2022 Compare with 2607: 0 is in pos2 (guess pos2 gives bull), 2 in pos3 (guess has 2 at pos0) and 7 in pos? (guess has 7 at pos3, but here it\u2019s in pos0) \u2192 1 bull, 2 cows.  \n\u2003\u2022 Compare with 1367: Only 7 appears (in pos0 here versus pos3 in guess) \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow.  \n\u2003\u2022 Compare with 5062: 0 (in pos2 here vs pos1 in guess) and 2 (in pos3 here vs pos3 in guess) \u2192 one bull (for 2) and one cow (for 0).\n\nEverything is consistent if the unknown candidate is 4. If it turns out that 4 is not the fourth digit, our feedback on our next guess will steer us toward trying 8 or 9 next.\n\nI propose our next guess as 7402.\nGUESS: 7402"

Here\u2019s a brief recap:\n\n\u2022 0123 returned 0 bulls and 2 cows, so exactly two digits among {0,1,2,3} are in the secret. The later guesses suggest those are 0 and 2.\n\u2022 2607 (digits {2,6,0,7}) yielded 1 bull and 2 cows. Given that 6 is unlikely (and 7 appears in other feedback), it appears that 2, 0, and 7 are the three digits matching from that guess. In particular, the bull in 2607 is most likely due to 2 in the first position.\n\u2022 1367 (involving {1,3,6,7}) gave 0 bulls and 1 cow. This points to only one of these being present, favoring the digit 7.\n\u2022 5062 returned 1 bull and 1 cow. Only digits 0 and 2 can account for this, because 5 and 6 have been ruled out. Analysis forces one of the known digits to be exactly in its guessed position\u2014if we suppose the secret\u2019s first digit is 2 (to explain the bull in 2607) and the second digit is 0 (to match the bull from 5062 when comparing with the guess where 0 is in position 1), then the remaining digit 7 must occupy another slot.\n\u2022 7402 produced 0 bulls and 3 cows. Its digits are {7,4,0,2}, and exactly three of these are in the secret. Since we are leaning on {7,0,2} as present, it tells us that 4 is not in the secret.\n\nThe only candidate remaining for the fourth digit (we\u2019ve seen 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 already) is one of {8,9}. Moreover, checking positional restrictions from previous guesses forces a likely assignment:\n\u2003\u2003Secret digit 1 = 2 (so that guess 2607 gives a bull at the 0th digit)\n\u2003\u2003Secret digit 2 = 0 (so that 5062 gives its bull when its 1st digit 0 is correctly placed)\n\u2003\u2003Secret digit 3 = 7 (to account for the cows in several guesses)\n\u2003\u2003Secret digit 4 = our unknown candidate, either 8 or 9\n\nA test arrangement might be: 2, 0, 7, X (with X = 8 or 9). For instance, if the secret were 2078 then:\n\u2003\u2022 0123 yields cows for 0 (from pos1) and 2 (from pos?) \u2192 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 2607: the 2 in pos0 gives a bull; the 0 and 7, when misplaced, yield 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 1367: only the 7 shows up as a misplaced digit \u2192 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2022 5062: the 0 in pos1 is exact (bull) and 2 appears elsewhere (cow) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2022 7402: 2, 0, and 7 appear in positions different from their guess positions \u2192 3 cows.\n\nTo decide between 8 and 9 for the unknown digit, our next guess should try one possibility. I propose guessing 2078. If it returns 4 bulls, we win. If it returns 3 bulls (with the only mismatch in the fourth digit), then the secret must be 2079.\n\nGUESS: 2078"

Thus, one scenario (let\u2019s call it Case A) is that the only digit from the first guess is 0. In that case the secret contains 0, and from the second guess it must have exactly one more digit among {4, 5, 6} (because 0 is already accounted for).

Then 0 is not in the secret, and from the second guess the two correct digits must come from {4, 5, 6}.\n\nI want our next guess to help differentiate between these scenarios. A promising idea is to try a guess that does not include 0 and yet tests digits from both suspect groups: using two digits from {1,2,3} and two digits from {4,5,6}.

Combined with guess 1, the secret\u2019s four digits come from one digit among {0,1,2,3} and three digits among {4,5,6,7}.\n\u2022 In Guess 3 (0674) we kept the digit from guess 1 in position 1 (0) but rearranged the group from guess 2 (using 6, 7, 4). The feedback was 1 bull and 1 cow. This tells us that the digit we carried over from guess 1 (0) is not the one\u2014the only candidate from guess 1 must be in its original position from guess 1. Among 0, 1, 2, and 3, by comparing positions we deduce that it can\u2019t be 0 (since placing 0 in pos1 in guess 3 would have repeated the bull from guess 1 and would have added extra matches if our secret contained all three digits from {6,7,4}). Consistency comes if we take the correct candidate from guess 1 to be 3 in position 4 (as 3 in guess 1 is the only possibility that, when lost from guess 3, leads to only two matches among the three candidate digits used there).\n\u2022 That forces the secret to use 3 (from guess 1) in position 4 and its other three digits from {4,5,6,7} must be exactly three of these four digits. By comparing the feedback from guess 2 and guess 3 carefully, we determine that the digit not used is 7 and the secret\u2019s subset is {4,5,6}.\n\u2022 Now the three positions other than position 4 (which is fixed as 3) must be filled with 4, 5, and 6 in an order that is consistent with the feedback:\n\u2003 \u25e6 From guess 2 (4567), with secret in positions 1\u20133 chosen from {4,5,6} the only order that gives exactly 1 bull and 2 cows is if the secret (positions 1\u20133) is arranged as 4, 6, 5. (For example, if secret were 4,6,5, then in guess 2: P1: digit 4 would be a bull, and the other two \u2013 digit 5 in secret appearing in position 3 and digit 6 in secret appearing in position 2 \u2013 would be cows.)\n\u2003 \u25e6 From guess 3 (0674), comparing with a secret of 4,6,5 in positions 1\u20133 and with 3 fixed in position 4, we get: P2: 6 yielding a bull (matching secret P2=6) and P4: 4 yielding a cow (since secret P1=4), which gives the reported 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\u2022 These deductions point uniquely to the secret candidate: 4653.\n\nI will now use 4653 as my next guess.\n\nGUESS: 4653"

The other three from 0, 1, 2, 3 do not appear anywhere.\n\n\u2022 Guess 2: 4567 \u2192 1 bull, 2 cows. With no repeated digits allowed and knowing the secret is 4 digits, this tells us that exactly three of the digits {4, 5, 6, 7} appear in the secret. Moreover, exactly one of them was placed in the correct position in this guess.\n\n\u2022 Guess 3: 0674 \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow. Note that 0 appears here (but recall from Guess 1 only one digit among 0,1,2,3 is in the secret) so depending on which candidate from {0,1,2,3} is \u201ccorrect\u201d it must appear in its original place from Guess 1. Also, from Guess 2 we know the secret already uses three digits from {4,5,6,7}. In Guess 3 the nonzero digits are 6, 7, and 4. Their overall contribution (bulls plus cows) would be the number of these digits present in the secret. With Guess 3\u2019s feedback (excluding the digit from the first group that might have been \u201ccarried over\u201d) the overlap from {6,7,4} must count 1 bull and 1 cow (i.e. exactly two of them are present) because the bull and cow reported come solely from these positions.\n\n\u2022 Guess 4: 4653 \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow. Here the digits are 4, 6, 5 from the group {4,5,6,7} (and 3 from the group {0,1,2,3}). This feedback must also be consistent with the secret\u2019s composition and the positions of its digits.\n\nA way to meet all of these is to suppose that the one digit from {0,1,2,3} that is used comes from 0123 in its original position. Testing the possibilities, a candidate that works is having the secret include 1 in position 2 (since in Guess 1 the 1 is in position 2) while the other three digits come from {4,5,6,7}. Furthermore, to match Guess 3 we must have only two of the three digits from {6,7,4} in the secret (because Guess 3 uses the digits 6, 7, and 4 in positions 2\u20134, and with our secret candidate the only overlap with these will come from the correct subset).\n\nOne arrangement that meets all the constraints is to take the secret as 4, 1, 7, 5.

        "content": "Let's summarize what we know with all five previous guesses:\n\n1. Guess 1 \u2013 0123 \u2192 1 bull, 0 cows. This tells us that exactly one digit among 0, 1, 2, and 3 is in the secret number \u2014 and it appears in the same position as in 0123. The other three digits from {0,1,2,3} do not appear anywhere.\n\n2. Guess 2 \u2013 4567 \u2192 1 bull, 2 cows. Since no digit repeats and the total match is 3, exactly three of {4, 5, 6, 7} are in the secret. One digit from that group is missing.\n\n3. Guess 3 \u2013 0674 \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow. Its digits are {0,6,7,4}. Recall that the secret\u2019s only digit from {0,1,2,3} must be in its original slot from guess 1. If that digit were 0 then it would have appeared in guess 3 position 1, but the feedback overall needs to come out correctly. (We\u2019ll come back to that.) Also note that among the last three digits of guess 3 (6,7,4) we see some overlap with the set from guess 2. The total match here is 2.\n\n4. Guess 4 \u2013 4653 \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow. Its digits are {4,6,5,3}. It again mixes one digit from the set {0,1,2,3} (namely the 3) with digits from {4,5,6,7}. This guess confirms that the three secret digits from {4,5,6,7} appear in different positions, but only two of them show up in guess 4.\n\n5. Guess 5 \u2013 4175 \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows. Its digits are {4,1,7,5}. Notice that guess 1\u2019s candidate is among {0,1,2,3} in its original slot. Here, if that candidate were 1 (position 2 in guess 1) then guess 5 would have a bull at position 2 (since guess 5 has 1 in position 2), but it doesn\u2019t. Thus the only possibility from guess 1 is that the secret contains 2 or 3 (if we consider positions 3 or 4) or possibly 0\u2014but checking with other guesses will rule some out.\n\nA promising scenario is to assume that the single digit from {0,1,2,3} in the secret is the 2 in position 3 (because guess 1\u2019s third digit is 2). Then the other three digits come from {4,5,6,7}; however, guess 2 tells us exactly three out of these four are present. In addition, notice in guess 3 (0674) the overlap (aside from 0) comes from digits among 6, 7, and 4. In order for guess 3 to yield just two matches (1 bull and 1 cow) the secret must contain only two of these three. In other words, the secret\u2019s trio from {4,5,6,7} cannot be exactly {4,6,7}\u2014it must include 5. In other words, the set of three digits from {4,5,6,7} is forced to be {5,6,7}.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose the secret is made of 2 (from guess 1) and {5,6,7} from guess 2. Also, because the correct digit from guess 1 has to appear in its original location, we set the digit 2 in position 3. That means the secret is: _ , _ , 2, _ with the remaining three digits being exactly 5, 6, and 7 in some order.\n\nNow look at guess 2 \u2013 4567. Its digits are 4, 5, 6, 7. Since our secret (from the {4,5,6,7} group) is {5,6,7} the overlap is exactly those three digits. For guess 2 to return 1 bull and 2 cows, exactly one of these three must be in the same position as they appear in 4567. In guess 2, the positions are:\n\u2003 Position 1: 4\u2003 Position 2: 5\u2003 Position 3: 6\u2003 Position 4: 7.\nSince 4 is not in the secret, one of positions 2, 3, or 4 will be a bull. But our secret already has 2 in position 3, so the bull must come from either position 2 or position 4 among the three digits {5,6,7}.\n\nNow consider guess 3 \u2013 0674. Its digits are:\n\u2003 Position 1: 0\u2003 Position 2: 6\u2003 Position 3: 7\u2003 Position 4: 4.\nSince our secret\u2019s group is {5,6,7}, the intersection with guess 3 is {6,7} (4 is not in our secret, and 0 is not because our candidate from guess 1 is 2). We need one of these to be a bull and the other a cow. That forces that both 6 and 7 are indeed in the secret (and they are) and that the bull occurs in the position where either 6 or 7 is placed.\n\nNext, look at guess 4 \u2013 4653. Its digits are:\n\u2003 Position 1: 4\u2003 Position 2: 6\u2003 Position 3: 5\u2003 Position 4: 3.\nThe intersection with our secret (which is {5,6,7} plus our 2 at position 3) is {5,6} (the digit 3 is not in the secret because we chose 2 from guess 1, not 3). For guess 4 we need 1 bull and 1 cow coming from these two. That means among positions 2 and 3 in guess 4, only one can be placed correctly (but note position 3 of secret is fixed as 2 so guess 4\u2019s digit 5 at position 3 cannot be a bull) and the other must appear in a different spot.\n\nFinally, check guess 5 \u2013 4175. Its digits are:\n\u2003 Position 1: 4\u2003 Position 2: 1\u2003 Position 3: 7\u2003 Position 4: 5.\nThe intersection with our secret {5,6,7} is {7,5} (since 1 and 4 are not among {5,6,7} and our candidate from guess1 is 2).

That strongly suggests the secret contains 0, 2, and 3 and is missing 1 (from guess 1) as well as 4 (from guess 2).\n\nThus the secret\u2019s digit set appears to be {0, 2, 3} plus one additional digit X that is not among 0,1,2,3,4. (So X is one of 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.)\n\nWe also have some positional restrictions:\n\u2022 From guess \"0123\": Since 0 was guessed in position 1 (and it turned up as a cow), 0 can\u2019t be in position 1; similarly, 2 can\u2019t be in position 3 and 3 can\u2019t be in position 4.\n\u2022 From the feedback on guess \"2034\": Only three of its digits appear in the secret. Since they most likely are 2, 0, and 3, we can try to \u201cplace\u201d them by testing different orders. One arrangement that meets both feedback sets is to have the secret arranged as follows:\n\u2003\u2003Position 1: 2\u2003\u2003(Position 1 in guess \"2034\" is 2 \u2192 would then be a bull)\n\u2003\u2003Position 2: unknown X (our extra digit from {5\u20139})\n\u2003\u2003Position 3: 3\u2003\u2003(Position 3 in guess \"2034\" is 3 \u2192 a bull)\n\u2003\u2003Position 4: 0\u2003\u2003(Position 4 in guess \"2034\" is 0?

One natural next guess is to test, for example, 8 for the unknown digit by guessing \"2830.\" If the secret is indeed 2830 then we will win; if not, the feedback (likely 3 bulls, 0 cows if 8 isn\u2019t present) will tell us that 8 is not the extra digit and let us try another candidate next.\n\nGUESS: 2830"

That tells us that exactly three of the digits {0,1,2,3} belong to the secret but none is in the same position as in \u201c0123.\u201d (The secret does not contain one of 0,1,2,3.)\n\n\u2022 Guess 2 (\u201c2034\u201d) gave 2 bulls and 1 cow. Its digits are {2,0,3,4}. Since we already got three matches from {0,1,2,3} in Guess 1, it now seems likely that the secret contains 0, 2, and 3 while excluding 1 (from \u201c0123\u201d) and also excludes 4 (present in \u201c2034\u201d) because we get exactly three matching digits in Guess 2. \n\n\u2022 Thus, the secret\u2019s digit set looks like {0,2,3,X} where X is some digit not in {0,1,2,3,4} (so X \u2208 {5,6,7,8,9}). \n\n\u2022 Next, we consider positional restrictions coming from the feedback on Guess 1: In \u201c0123\u201d the secret got 0 cows in the guessed positions so 0 cannot be in position 1, 2 cannot be in position 3, and 3 cannot be in position 4.  \n\u2003\u2003Likewise, looking at Guess 2 (\u201c2034\u201d) which gives 2 bulls and 1 cow based solely on the three common digits {2,0,3} (since 4 is not in the secret), one workable placement is to \u201clock in\u201d the positions of two of these digits. One possibility consistent with both guesses is that positions 2, 3, and 4 of the secret end up holding 0, 3, and 2 (in some order) so that when comparing with \u201c0123\u201d they all appear in different slots and, in \u201c2034,\u201d two are exactly in place while the remaining one is present but offset. A natural arrangement that fits is to have the secret be of the form:\n\n\u2003\u2003Secret = (X, 0, 3, 2)\n\nLet\u2019s check that quickly:\n\u2003\u2022 For Guess 1 \u201c0123\u201d: \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Secret has 0,3,2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In \u201c0123\u201d the 0 is in position 1 but in secret 0 is position 2 (cow); 2 is in pos3 in \u201c0123\u201d but in secret pos4 (cow); 3 is in pos4 in \u201c0123\u201d but in secret pos3 (cow). That yields 0 bulls and 3 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 For Guess 2 \u201c2034\u201d: \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Positions: secret (X,0,3,2) vs guess: 2,0,3,4.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 0 in secret pos2 and guess pos2 \u2192 bull; 3 in secret pos3 and guess pos3 \u2192 bull; and 2 appears in secret pos4 while guess has 2 in pos1 \u2192 cow. That gives 2 bulls and 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2022 For Guess 3 \u201c2830\u201d: \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Compare secret (X,0,3,2) to guess: 2,8,3,0.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Here we already see: if the secret\u2019s unknown digit X isn\u2019t 2 (and it can\u2019t be because 2 is already used) then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003pos1: 2 (guess) vs X (secret) \u2013 no bull, but 2 is in secret pos4 \u2192 cow;\n\u2003\u2003\u2003pos2: 8 vs 0 \u2013 no match;\n\u2003\u2003\u2003pos3: 3 vs 3 \u2192 bull;\n\u2003\u2003\u2003pos4: 0 vs 2 \u2013 no bull, but 0 is secret pos2 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003That gives 1 bull and 2 cows, exactly as reported.\n\nSo the picture now is that the secret uses digits {0,2,3} placed in positions 2, 3, and 4 exactly as (0,3,2) and the unknown digit X (which must be one of {5,6,7,8,9} but note later we\u2019ll see that X cannot be 8) sits in position 1.\n\nOne way to test whether X might be 9 is to \u201cfill in\u201d position 1 with 9 while leaving our deduced positions intact. In other words, we try the guess:\n\n\u2003\u2003Guess = 9 0 3 2\n\nLet\u2019s see what that would yield if the secret were (X,0,3,2):\n\u2003\u2022 If X = 9 (so the secret is 9,0,3,2), then comparing with \u201c9032\u201d we\u2019d get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos1: 9 vs 9 \u2192 bull; pos2: 0 vs 0 \u2192 bull; pos3: 3 vs 3 \u2192 bull; pos4: 2 vs 2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003That would be a win (4 bulls).\n\u2003\u2022 If instead X is not 9 (say X \u2208 {5,6,7}) then in \u201c9032\u201d we compare:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos1: 9 vs X (no match, and 9 is not in the rest of the secret) \u2192 no bull;\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos2: 0 vs 0 \u2192 bull;\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos3: 3 vs 3 \u2192 bull;\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos4: 2 vs 2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003That would yield 3 bulls and 0 cows.\n\nThus, by guessing 9032 we can immediately tell if X is 9 (winning if we get 4 bulls) or not (if we get 3 bulls). In the latter case we\u2019d know the arrangement \u201c(X,0,3,2)\u201d is correct and that X is one of {5,6,7}.\n\nI will use 9032 as my next guess.\n\nGUESS: 9032"

Because only digits 1 and 2 appear in both the first two guesses, it strongly indicates that 1 and 2 are the correct digits from our initial guess while 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not in the secret.\n\u2022 In Guess 2 the 1 (position 2) and 2 (position 4) were cows. This means in the secret number, 1 is not in position 2 and 2 is not in position 4.\n\u2022 Guess 3 (2017) yielded 1 bull and 1 cow with digits 2, 0, 1, 7. Since we expect only 1 and 2 from this set to be in the secret (given the earlier results), the bull and cow must come from 1 and 2. In 2017, 2 is in position 1 and 1 is in position 3. For example, if the secret had 2 in position 2 (making the guess\u2019s 2 at position 1 a cow) and 1 in position 3 (making that digit a bull), we would see exactly 1 bull (from the correctly placed 1) and 1 cow (since 2 is present but in a different position). This scenario satisfies all our previous constraints.\n\u2022 With 1 and 2 confirmed, the remaining two digits must come from those not appearing in our earlier guesses. Excluding 3,4,5,6 (and also eliminating 0 and 7 based on the feedback from 2017 if they were in the secret) leaves possibilities among {8,9} for the other two positions.\nOne arrangement that fits all constraints is having the secret as 9,2,1,8:\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess 1 (1234): The 2 in position 2 is a bull (secret position 2 is 2) and the 1 in position 1 is in secret (at position 3) so it\u2019s a cow \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess 2 (5162): The digits 1 and 2 appear in the secret but in different positions than in the guess (1 is in secret position 3, 2 in secret position 2) \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2013 In Guess 3 (2017): The 1 in position 3 exactly matches secret position 3 (bull) and the 2 in position 1 is in the secret (position 2) but misplaced (cow) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\nThus, 9218 is fully consistent with the clues so far.\nGUESS: 9218"

        "content": "We now have to reexamine what our responses tell us. Let\u2019s denote the secret as four distinct digits and review our four guesses:\n\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 1 (1234) gave 1 bull and 1 cow. This means exactly two of {1,2,3,4} are in the secret number.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 2 (5162) gave 0 bulls and 2 cows. Its digits {5,1,6,2} share with guess 1 the digits 1 and 2. For the result to be 2 cows here, the two correct digits from guess 1 must be \u201csplit\u201d between {1,2} and {3,4} or similar. In fact, if both 1 and 2 were present in the secret, then guess 2 would contain those two (because 2 is repeated in guesses 1 and 2) and we would have at least two common digits; however, guess 4 below forces caution.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 3 (2017) gave 1 bull and 1 cow. Its digits {2,0,1,7} share with guess 1 and/or guess 2 at least one of the digits 1 or 2. \n\u2003\u2022 Guess 4 (9218) gave 0 bulls and 1 cow. Its digits {9,2,1,8} show only one digit from the secret is present. Notice that if both 1 and 2 were in the secret, guess 4 would have two common digits (since 9,8 are new); therefore the secret cannot contain both 1 and 2. Thus one of 1 or 2 is in the secret and the other is not.\n\nBecause guess 1 must contribute 2 digits\u2014and we now know it cannot be both 1 and 2\u2014the other correct digit from {1,2,3,4} must come from {3,4}. So one digit from {1,2} is in the secret and one from {3,4} is as well.\n\nLooking at guess 2 (5162) with its 0 bulls and 2 cows, its two common digits must be the one from {1,2} (whichever is present) plus one digit from {5,6} (because 2 from guess 2 could be the digit from {1,2} if 2 is in the secret, or 1 if 1 is in the secret). Similarly, guess 3 (2017) returned 1 bull and 1 cow. Its digits include the candidate from {1,2} (whichever is in the secret) and then one digit from {0,7} (since, besides 1 and 2, none of the others appear in previous guesses except in guess 4 we already ruled out 9 and 8). Finally, guess 4 (9218) shows that among {9,2,1,8} only one is in the secret\u2014and that must be the one from {1,2} (if 1 is in, then 2 is out, or vice\u2010versa).\n\nThus the secret\u2019s digits come from these four groups:\n\u2003\u2013 One from {1,2}\u2003\u2003(from guesses 1, 2, 3, and 4)\n\u2003\u2013 One from {3,4}\u2003\u2003(from guess 1)\n\u2003\u2013 One from {5,6}\u2003\u2003(from guess 2)\n\u2003\u2013 One from {0,7}\u2003\u2003(from guess 3)\n\nFor example, one consistent possibility would be if the secret had 1 (not 2), 3 (or 4), 5 (or 6), and 0 (or 7). Alternatively, if 2 is chosen from {1,2} then the secret might include 2 with, say, 3, with one from {5,6} and one from {0,7}. In our earlier analysis we found candidates such as 1053, 1457, or 2735 (when arranged appropriately) would all satisfy the feedback so far.\n\nOur next guess should help discriminate between these alternatives, especially to decide whether the secret has a 1 or a 2 (since guess 4 already limited us to one of them) and to test the differing candidates in the other groups (i.e. is it a 3 or a 4, and is it a 0 or a 7?).\n\nA good candidate is one that uses both 1 and 2 and also includes digits 7 and 4. For instance, let\u2019s consider the guess 1274. Let\u2019s check what responses we\u2019d expect against our candidate sets:\n\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret were, say, 1053 (digits {1,0,5,3}), then only 1 is common. In 1274, the 1 is in position 1. In secret 1053, the likely placement of 1 would be (if matching our earlier placement) also in pos1. That would yield 1 bull. No other digit (2,7,4) is in 1053, so we\u2019d see 1 bull, 0 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret were, for example, 1457 (digits {1,4,5,7}), then the common digits with 1274 would be 1, 7, and 4. With an appropriate arrangement, we could have 1 in the correct place (say, pos1) and the other two misplaced, giving 1 bull, 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret were, for instance, 2735 (digits {2,7,3,5}), then the common digits with 1274 would be 2 and 7. They might both be misplaced or one in place; for example, if 7 ends up at the correct position but 2 does not, we might get 1 bull, 1 cow; or if both are misplaced, we\u2019d get 0 bulls, 2 cows. (One of these outcomes should occur distinctly from the other candidates.)\n\nBecause the three sets yield different potential feedback (for example, 1 bull,0 cows versus 1 bull,2 cows versus 0 bulls,2 cows), this guess effectively differentiates among the possibilities.\n\nI will now make the next guess using 1274.\n\nGUESS: 1274"

The bull must come from one of these being positioned exactly, while the other is misplaced.  \n\u2022 In Guess 4 (9218: 0 bulls, 1 cow), only one digit from Group A appears (since it contains both 9,2,1,8 but we already know only one from {1,2} belongs to the secret).  \n\u2022 In Guess 5 (1274: 1 bull, 1 cow), the guess contains two digits from Group A (1 and 2), one candidate from Group D (7) and one from Group B (4 or 3); the feedback of \u201c2 hits\u201d tells us that only two of these are actually in the secret.

With 2 already giving the bull in guess 0123 when it was in position 2, we deduce that digit 2 is correctly placed at position 2.

Exactly two of these are in the secret and they are placed correctly in this guess. This tells us that if one comes from the pair {2, 0} (which also appear in the other guesses) the other must come from {6,7}.\n\n\u2022 Finally, guess 8920 gave 1 bull and 0 cows. Its digits are {8, 9, 2, 0}. Because we get exactly one bull\u2014and no other digit even appears out of place\u2014only one digit among these is actually in the secret and it is exactly in its guessed position.\n\nA key observation comes from analyzing guess8920. Notice that its last two digits (2 and 0) have already appeared in the earlier guesses. If both 2 and 0 were in the secret and placed as in guess6720, then guess8920 would have at least 2 bulls (if for example 2 were correctly placed in position 2 and 0 in position 3). Because guess8920 has only 1 bull, it forces us to conclude that the secret cannot contain both 2 and 0. \n\nNow consider the information from the other guesses. In guess2045, two digits must be present. The only candidates from the group {2, 0, 4, 5} that can work with guess8920\u2019s \u201c1 bull\u201d constraint are to have 2 in the secret (to be that one bull in guess8920 when it appears in position 2) and then from 2045 the second contributing digit must be chosen from {4, 5} rather than 0. Meanwhile, guess0123 tells us that two of {0, 1, 2, 3} are in secret; if we choose 2 from there, then the other must come from {1,3} (and not 0 because we are now excluding 0).\n\nSo far we then have:\n\u2003\u2022 from these intersections, digit 2 is in the secret and (by requirements from guess8920) must be in position 2.\n\u2003\u2022 Also, one more digit comes from {1,3} (from guess0123) and one digit comes from {4,5} (to complete the two from guess2045).\n\u2003\u2022 Finally, guess6720, which is 6, 7, 2, 0, must yield 2 bulls. We already have a bull from 2 (if secret pos2 = 2). To reach 2 bulls, one of {6, 7} must be in the secret in its position from guess6720. (Since we have excluded 0 and now are using 2, the extra bull must be either 6 or 7 in the corresponding position in guess6720.)\n\nCollecting the candidate groups:\n\u2003\u2013 One hit from {1, 3} (from guess0123)\n\u2003\u2013 2 is fixed.\n\u2003\u2013 One hit from {4, 5} (from guess2045)\n\u2003\u2013 One hit from {6, 7} (from guess6720), and it must occupy the same place as in guess6720.\n\nThis makes a total of 4 digits. One arrangement that fits all conditions is to take 3 (from {1,3}), 4 (from {4,5}), and 6 (from {6,7}). Let\u2019s test the candidate secret: 6, 3, 2, 4 (i.e. secret = 6324).\n\nNow verify against each guess:\n\u2022 Guess 0123 (0, 1, 2, 3):\n\u2003 Compare with 6324:\n\u2003 position0: 0 vs 6 \u2192 no match.\n\u2003 position1: 1 vs 3 \u2192 no match.\n\u2003 position2: 2 vs 2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003 position3: 3 vs 4 \u2192 no match; but digit 3 is in secret at position1 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003 Result: 1 bull, 1 cow. \u2713\n\n\u2022 Guess 2045 (2, 0, 4, 5):\n\u2003 positions:\n\u2003 position0: 2 vs 6 \u2192 no match; but 2 is in secret at pos2 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003 position1: 0 vs 3 \u2192 0 is not in secret.\n\u2003 position2: 4 vs 2 \u2192 no match; but 4 is in secret at pos3 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003 position3: 5 vs 4 \u2192 5 is not in secret.\n\u2003 Result: 0 bulls, 2 cows. \u2713\n\n\u2022 Guess 6720 (6, 7, 2, 0):\n\u2003 positions:\n\u2003 position0: 6 vs 6 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003 position1: 7 vs 3 \u2192 7 is not in secret.\n\u2003 position2: 2 vs 2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003 position3: 0 vs 4 \u2192 0 is not in secret.\n\u2003 Result: 2 bulls, 0 cows. \u2713\n\n\u2022 Guess 8920 (8, 9, 2, 0):\n\u2003 positions:\n\u2003 position0: 8 vs 6 \u2192 no match.\n\u2003 position1: 9 vs 3 \u2192 no match.\n\u2003 position2: 2 vs 2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003 position3: 0 vs 4 \u2192 no match.\n\u2003 No other digits appear.\n\u2003 Result: 1 bull, 0 cows. \u2713\n\nAll the clues check out with secret = 6324.\n\nMy next guess to test this possibility is 6324.\n\nGUESS: 6324"

That tells us exactly 2 digits among {0, 1, 2, 3} are in the secret.\n\u2022 In guess 2045, we got 0 bulls and 2 cows. So exactly 2 digits from {2, 0, 4, 5} are present, each in a different position than guessed.\n\u2022 In guess 6720 (digits 6, 7, 2, 0) we got 2 bulls and 0 cows. This means that exactly 2 of these digits are in the secret and appearing in the same positions as guessed; the other 2 digits in this guess are not in the secret at all.\n\u2022 In guess 8920 (8, 9, 2, 0) result was 1 bull and 0 cows. With 2 appearing repeatedly in the third position (pos2), it\u2019s most natural to assume that digit 2 is indeed in the secret and correctly placed at position 2; then none of 8, 9, or 0 appear.\n\u2022 In guess 6324 we got 2 bulls and 0 cows. This guess (6, 3, 2, 4) confirms that with 2 at pos2 being one bull, exactly one more digit is correctly placed and the other two digits are not in the secret.\n\nLet\u2019s use these clues:\n\n1. From guess 8920, if we assume digit 2 is the bull (at pos2), then 0 is not in the secret.\n2. From guess 6720, with 2 (at pos2) verified and 0 excluded, the other bull must come from 6 (in pos0) or 7 (in pos1). Suppose we take the possibility that 6 in position 0 is the bull. That forces digits 7 and 0 from that guess to be absent.\n3. With 0 eliminated, review guess 2045 (2, 0, 4, 5). We already have 2; to account for 2 cows here the other contributor has to come from {4, 5} (since 0 is out).\n4. Now consider guess 0123: among {0, 1, 2, 3}, with 0 out and 2 present, the remaining matching digit must come from {1, 3}. However, we also see in guess 6324 (6, 3, 2, 4) that we already count a bull from 6 (pos0) and 2 (pos2). To have exactly 2 bulls, neither 3 (pos1) nor 4 (pos3) can show up elsewhere in the secret. That forces us to choose 1 from {1, 3} \u2013 specifically 1 must be in the secret (since 3 is ruled out by guess 6324, as its occurrence would yield an extra cow in that guess).\n5. So far, with this assumption we have:\n\u2003\u2022 from guess 6720: bull 6 at pos0 and bull 2 at pos2;\n\u2003\u2022 from guess 0123: besides 2, the other digit is 1 (but note in guess 0123, 1 is at pos1 \u2013 which must be a cow since its correct position in the secret is not pos1);\n\u2003\u2022 from guess 2045: besides 2, the other digit is taken from {4, 5}. And guess 6324 shows that 4 (in pos3) cannot be in the secret (or it would have given a bull or cow there), so that digit is 5.\n6. Filling in the positions: We already have pos0 = 6, pos2 = 2. The digit 1 must be in a different position than pos1 (because guess 0123 gave a cow for 1), so 1 cannot go to pos1. That leaves placing 1 in pos3 and 5 in pos1.\n7. This yields the secret candidate: [6, 5, 2, 1].\n\nWe verify quickly:\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 0123 vs 6521: pos2:2 is a bull; digit 1 is in secret (at pos3) while guessed at pos1 \u2192 cow. (1 bull, 1 cow.)\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 2045 vs 6521: digit 2 (at pos2) is in secret (but guessed at pos0) \u2192 cow; digit 5 (in secret at pos1) appears in guess at pos3 \u2192 cow. (0 bulls, 2 cows.)\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 6720 vs 6521: pos0:6 bull; pos2:2 bull; the others (7,0) are not in secret. (2 bulls, 0 cows.)\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 8920 vs 6521: pos2:2 bull; digits 8,9,0 are not present. (1 bull, 0 cows.)\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 6324 vs 6521: pos0:6 bull; pos2:2 bull; digits 3 and 4 are not in secret. (2 bulls, 0 cows.)\n\nEvery response is satisfied by secret being 6521.\n\nThus, my next guess is 6521.\n\nGUESS: 6521"

In the first guess 0123 we got one bull and one cow, meaning exactly two of those four digits are included in the secret number. Then in 0425 we got two bulls and one cow; note that guess uses 0 and 2 (from the first guess), plus two new digits (4 and 5). This suggests that the secret number contains both 0 and 2 and exactly one of 4 or 5. (Since 0425 has three \u201ccorrect\u201d digits overall.) Also, from the feedback on 0123 the two digits from {0,1,2,3} that are in the secret must appear in such a way that one is in the correct spot while the other is not.\n\nA likely scenario is that 0 and 2 appear in the secret (though not necessarily in the same positions as in our guesses) and that among 4 and 5 only one is present. We have not yet determined the positions of 0 and 2 (which one is a bull in 0123 is still ambiguous) and we do not know which of 4 or 5 is in play. Finally, the fourth digit in the secret has not been tested at all.\n\nTo help resolve these ambiguities we want to do two things in our next guess:\n1. Rearrange 0 and 2 so that we can tell which one might be in its \u201ccorrect\u201d spot from previous guesses.\n2. Include one candidate (say 5) from the ambiguous pair {4, 5} while also introducing a new digit (for example, 7) for the fourth position.\n\nI propose the guess 0 2 5 7. Here 0, 2, and 5 are positioned differently from previous turns. Then the feedback will help us decide not only which arrangement of 0 and 2 might be correct but also whether 5 is indeed in the secret (if it is not, then the alternative must be 4).\n\nGUESS: 0257"

Notably, the only common digits in both these guesses are 0 and 2, so it is very plausible that 0 and 2 are in the secret. In 0425 we added 4 and 5 and obtained 2 bulls and 1 cow, which strongly suggests that one of 4 or 5 is present along with 0 and 2. When we then guessed 0257 we got exactly two correct digits \u2013 and since 5 and 7 appeared here (and neither produced additional matches beyond the 0 and 2) it points us toward 5 not being in the secret. Thus the three confirmed candidate digits become 0, 2, and 4.\n\nThere is one more digit missing. Our earlier results imply that among the guessed digits only 0, 2, and possibly 4 count. And looking at the positions from guess1 it turns out exactly one of 0 and 2 was placed correctly, so one arrangement that satisfies all three responses is having the secret be arranged as:\n\u2003\u2003position1: 0\n\u2003\u2003position2: 4\n\u2003\u2003position3: (an unknown digit, not among any we\u2019ve seen in our guesses that were ruled out \u2013 candidates like 6, 8, or 9 are possible)\n\u2003\u2003position4: 2\n\nLet\u2019s check this arrangement against our previous feedback:\n\u2002\u2002\u2022 For guess 0123: 0 in pos1 matches (bull) and 2 appears later (cow) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\u2002\u2002\u2022 For guess 0425: 0 in pos1 and 4 in pos2 match exactly (bulls) while 2, though guessed in pos3, is actually in pos4 (cow) \u2192 2 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2002\u2002\u2022 For guess 0257: 0 in pos1 (bull) and 2, though guessed in pos2, exists in secret in pos4 (cow) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\nOne consistent candidate then to test our theory is by trying one option for the unknown digit. I will pick 6 as a candidate. This leads to the guess 0, 4, 6, 2. If this guess turns out to be the secret, we win.

Given our current understanding, those three must be 4, 3, and 2. This implies that 1 is not in the secret.\n\u2022 In 5142 we got 0 bulls and 2 cows. Since 5 isn\u2019t part of the secret, the two cows came from two of {1, 4, 2}. And because 1 isn\u2019t in the secret, that confirms 4 and 2 are present, though not in the positions from that guess.\n\u2022 Now, with 4326 giving us 3 bulls, it strongly indicates that the secret begins with 4, 3, 2 (in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively) and that the fourth digit is not 6.\n\nThus the secret number appears to be 4-3-2-X, where X is a digit not among {1,2,3,4,6,5} \u2013 and not 6 as we just ruled out. The missing digit X could be among the remaining ones {0,7,8,9}. \n\nTo narrow this down further, I\u2019ll test one possibility for the fourth digit. I\u2019ll choose 7 to see if it completes the secret. My next guess is 4327.\n\nGUESS: 4327"

In our guess 4567 we got 0 bulls and 3 cows, which tells us that exactly three of those four digits are in the secret but in different positions than in that guess. Then in guess 7856, we got 1 bull and 1 cow. (Recall that in guess 7856 the digits from 4\u20137 present are 7, 5, and 6.) That means the secret\u2019s four digits consist of one extra digit (not 0\u20133 or 8) plus three of the digits from 4, 5, 6, 7. (Because if the extra digit were 8 then guess 7856 would have at least 3 correct digits, contradicting the 1 bull and 1 cow we saw.) Thus it\u2019s most likely that the extra digit is 9, and the secret is made up of 9 and three digits chosen from 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nWe now have three possibilities for the candidate set from {4, 5, 6, 7}: it could be {4,5,6} (if 7 is absent), {4,5,7} (if 6 is absent), or {4,6,7} (if 5 is absent).

Since the secret must have exactly three of {4,5,6,7} (and 9), if we include 9 and all four of these digits in our guess, the response should tell us whether we have all four or only three. In particular, if we guess a number whose digits include 9 and 4, 5, 6 then the total number of correct digits (bulls plus cows) will be 4 if the three candidate digits in the secret are exactly 4, 5, and 6. Otherwise if one of these is not in the secret (and the secret instead contains the other candidate from {4,5,7} or {4,6,7}, etc.) then our guess will have only 3 matching digits.\n\nSo I propose the next guess to be: 9456.\nHere the digits are:\n\u2022 9 \u2013 our likely extra digit.\n\u2022 4, 5, 6 \u2013 a test set from 4,5,6,7.\nIf we get feedback indicating all four digits are correct (in some bull/cow combination), then that tells us the secret\u2019s candidate set is {4,5,6} (meaning 7 is absent). If we get feedback showing only three of these digits are in the secret, then the missing one among these is not in the secret and the extra candidate from {7} must be used instead (or vice\u2010versa if we later try a guess that includes 7 instead of either 5 or 6).\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with 9456 as our next guess.\n\nGUESS: 9456"

On the other hand, if the extra digit is not 7 (say it is 8 or 9) then the feedback would be different.

However, the change of positions in the second guess (\u201c1324\u201d) produced 1 bull and 1 cow, so the pair of digits that belong to the secret did not both remain in their original places. For example, if the bulls in the first guess were in positions 1 and 3 (i.e. s1 = 1 and s3 = 3), then in the second guess keeping 1 at pos1 makes it stay a bull while moving 3 from pos3 to pos2 makes it a cow. (Other possibilities exist too, such as the bulls being in positions 1 and 2, or positions 2 and 4, or 3 and 4.) \n\nA good next step is to try a guess that uses two of the digits from {1,2,3,4}\u2014to continue checking which ones are \u201cfixed\u201d\u2014and to introduce two new digits that might be the ones filling the secret\u2019s remaining positions.

Then our second guess (1324) produced 1 bull and 1 cow, and our third guess (1205) yielded 2 bulls and 0 cows. In the third guess, since we introduced two new digits (0 and 5) and got 0 cows, those two digits are not in the secret number. This suggests that the two correct digits from the first guess likely are in positions 1 and 2 (the digits 1 and 2) because keeping them produced 2 bulls in guess 1205 without interference from 0 and 5.\n\nThus, it appears the secret number begins with 1 and 2 in positions 1 and 2, and the two digits from 1234 that did not produce bulls (and are now shown not to be present) are not in the secret.

Here\u2019s a summary of our deductions:\n\n\u2022 In the first guess, 1234 yielded 2 bulls and 0 cows. That tells us exactly two of these digits are in the secret \u00ad\u2013 and in the same positions as guessed \u2013 while the other two do not appear at all.\n\n\u2022 Our third guess, 1205, produced 2 bulls and 0 cows. In that guess we kept 1 and 2 in the same positions as in 1234 while introducing 0 and 5. Since we got 0 cows, 0 and 5 cannot be in the secret number. This reinforces that the two correct digits from 1234 are in the positions we kept when changing the other two numbers.\n\n\u2022 Our fourth guess, 1267, resulted in 1 bull and 1 cow. Comparing guesses shows that if we assume the correct positions from 1234 are positions 2 and 4, then the secret would contain the digits from those positions (2 and 4) exactly in those spots. With 0 and 5 eliminated from guess 3, it leads us to the likely scenario that the secret is of the form X,2,0,4 or something similar\u2014with the two digits (from the original 1234) that were not bulls omitted and new digits filling the unknown position(s).\n\nAnalyzing the feedback, a consistent possibility is that the secret has the form D,2,0,4 (with D unknown). For example, if we let D = 6 then\n\u2003Secret = 6,2,0,4:\n\u2003\u2022 1234 gives bulls at positions 2 and 4 (digits 2 and 4) \u2192 2 bulls, 0 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 1205 gives bulls at positions 2 and 3 (2 and 0) \u2192 2 bulls, 0 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 1267 gives a bull at position 2 (digit 2) and a cow from digit 6 (present in secret at position 1, though guessed in pos3 or pos1) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\nAlternatively, if D = 7 then\n\u2003Secret = 7,2,0,4:\n\u2003\u2022 1234 \u2192 bulls at positions 2 and 4.\n\u2003\u2022 1205 \u2192 bulls at positions 2 and 3.\n\u2003\u2022 1267 \u2192 bull at pos2 (2) and cow from digit 7 (which is in secret at pos1 though guessed elsewhere) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\nBoth 6204 and 7204 fit all our past responses.\n\nTo distinguish between these candidates, we need a guess that tests the unknown digit in the first position. I propose using 7206. In that guess, we keep 7 in the first position, 2 in the second, 0 in the third, and use a new digit 6 in the fourth slot. Here\u2019s how it distinguishes the possibilities:\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret is 7204, then 7206 would have 7,2,0 exactly matching positions 1,2,3 (3 bulls) and a wrong digit in position 4 \u2013 yielding 3 bulls and 0 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 If the secret is 6204, then the digit 7 would not match (since secret\u2019s first digit is 6) but 2 and 0 in positions 2 and 3 would be bulls. Also, the digit 6 in pos4 of the guess is in fact the secret\u2019s first digit, which would be counted as a cow. This would give feedback of 2 bulls and 1 cow.\n\nEither outcome will help us decide the correct secret.\n\nGUESS: 7206"

With secret[1] = 1 already secured, the only way to get a second bull is for one of the remaining positions to have a matching digit. Given that from guess 1 we are assuming digits 2 (in pos2) and 4 (in pos4) are not in the secret, the only option is that digit 5 (in pos4 of guess 3) is a bull. Thus, secret[4] = 5. This also confirms that digits 2 and 0 from that guess do not appear in the secret.\n\n\u2022 Then our secret seems to shape up as 1, X, 3, 5 with an unknown digit X in the second position.\n\n\u2022 In guess 4 (1267), with digits 1,2,6,7, we got 1 bull and 1 cow. We already have the bull at position 1 (the 1), and since we\u2019ve excluded 2 (and 4 from guess 1) the extra correct digit must come from either 6 or 7 appearing elsewhere in the secret.

With our secret in the form 1, X, 3, 5, none of the guessed positions directly match. For there to be one cow, one of the digits 7 or 6 must be in the secret but in the wrong position.

Since the secret number is 4 distinct digits and 0 is fixed as the bull in position 0, the secret number must consist of 0, 7, 8, and 9 with 0 in the first position.\n\nTo further refine the positions of 7, 8, and 9, I will now try the guess 0789, which keeps 0 fixed in the first position and tests one ordering of the remaining three digits.\n\nGUESS: 0789"

        "content": "Let's summarize our deductions so far.\n\n\u2022 From the first guess (0123) we got 1 bull and 0 cows. That tells us exactly one digit from {0,1,2,3} is in the secret and is correctly placed while the other three do not appear at all.\n\n\u2022 From the second guess (0456) we also got 1 bull and 0 cows. In that guess the digits are {0,4,5,6}. Note that if 0 were the bull in the first guess it would appear as the bull in the second guess too\u2014but then in our third guess 0 in the same position would have produced a bull. Since guess three (0789) gave 0 bulls, 2 cows, 0 is forced out. Hence, the bull in guess\u202f1 must be one of {1,2,3} (and that digit is in its same position as in 0123) and the bull in guess\u202f2 must be one of {4,5,6} (and appears in its same position as in 0456).\n\n\u2022 In guess\u202f3 (0789) we got 0 bulls and 2 cows. That means exactly 2 of these digits are in the secret but in other positions. Since we\u2019ve now eliminated 0 from the secret, the two \u201chidden\u201d digits must come from {7,8,9}.\n\nThus, the secret must consist of four distinct digits:\n\u2003\u2013 One digit from {1,2,3} (coming from guess\u202f1)\n\u2003\u2013 One digit from {4,5,6} (coming from guess\u202f2)\n\u2003\u2013 Two digits from {7,8,9} (from guess\u202f3)\n\nFurthermore, note that since these bulls came in fixed positions in the previous guesses:\n\u2003\u2022 In 0123 the candidates from {1,2,3} appear as: 1 at position\u202f1, 2 at position\u202f2, 3 at position\u202f3.\n\u2003\u2022 In 0456 the candidates from {4,5,6} appear as: 4 at position\u202f1, 5 at position\u202f2, 6 at position\u202f3.\nThey cannot share a position with one another in the secret. For example, if we suppose the bull in guess\u202f1 is \u20182\u2019 (so secret position\u202f2 is 2) then the bull in guess\u202f2 cannot be \u20185\u2019 (which is also in position\u202f2); it must be either 4 (in position\u202f1) or 6 (in position\u202f3).\n\nA promising candidate that meets these constraints is one in which we assign, say, 2 (from {1,2,3}) in position\u202f2 and 4 (from {4,5,6}) in position\u202f1. Then, from {7,8,9} we need two digits; let\u2019s pick 8 and 7. One valid ordering with these four digits is 8,4,2,7:\n\u2003Secret candidate = 8 (pos0), 4 (pos1), 2 (pos2), 7 (pos3).\n\nLet\u2019s quickly check:\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 0123: common digit is 2 at pos2 \u2192 exactly 1 bull.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 0456: common digit is 4 at pos1 \u2192 exactly 1 bull.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 0789: common digits are 8 and 7.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In guess\u202f3, 8 is in position\u202f2 but in candidate it\u2019s in pos0, and 7 is in pos? In candidate it\u2019s pos3 while in guess\u202f3, 7 is pos1.\n\u2003Thus, 0 bulls and 2 cows.\n\nThese fit all our responses.\n\nMy next step is to test the positions of these four candidate digits more directly. I will now try a guess that uses the same four digits {8,4,2,7} but in a different arrangement. One promising ordering is 8247. Let\u2019s see what that does when compared to our candidate:\n\u2003For candidate secret 8,4,2,7 versus guess 8247:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Position 0: 8 vs 8 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Position 1: 2 vs 4 \u2192 2 is elsewhere in secret (secret has 2 in pos2) \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Position 2: 4 vs 2 \u2192 cow (4 is in pos1).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Position 3: 7 vs 7 \u2192 bull.\nThat would yield 2 bulls and 2 cows, which would be quite informative.\n\nI\u2019ll use 8247 as the next guess.\n\nGUESS: 8247"

        "content": "Based on our responses so far, let\u2019s summarize our deductions:\n\n1. Guess \u201c0123\u201d (response: 1 bull, 0 cows) tells us that exactly one digit among {0, 1, 2, 3} is present in the secret and is in the same position as in the guess. Because there were no cows, the three other digits do not appear at all. Also note that digit 0 appears in several guesses; if 0 were the bull (from position 0) in \u201c0123,\u201d it would reappear as a bull in \u201c0456\u201d (since 0 is again candidate in pos0), and in \u201c0789\u201d it would yield a bull\u2014but we saw 0 bulls there. Thus 0 is eliminated. So the one confirmed candidate from guess 1 must be from {1, 2, 3} at positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively.\n\n2. Guess \u201c0456\u201d (response: 1 bull, 0 cows) now, without 0, tells us that exactly one digit among {4, 5, 6} is in the secret and in its same position (positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively), and the other two are absent.\n\n3. Guess \u201c0789\u201d (response: 0 bulls, 2 cows), after eliminating 0, gives us that exactly two digits among {7, 8, 9} are in the secret but in different positions (none is in the same position as they appear in \u201c0789\u201d \u2013 positions 1,2,3 for 7,8,9 respectively).\n\n4. This means the secret number must be made up of four distinct digits distributed as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 One digit from {1, 2, 3} in its corresponding position from \u201c0123.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 One digit from {4, 5, 6} in its corresponding position from \u201c0456.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Two digits from {7, 8, 9} (with the constraint that if 7 is present, it cannot be in position 1; if 8 is present, cannot be in position 2; if 9, cannot be in position 3).\n\n5. Notice that positions 1,2,3 are \u201coccupied\u201d by the bull candidates from guess 1 and guess 2 (with each candidate fixed to the same position they occupy in those guesses). Since the two confirmed groups from guess 1 and guess 2 only use positions among 1,2,3, the remaining position (position 0) must be taken by one of the two digits chosen from {7,8,9}.\n\n6. Now let\u2019s look at guess \u201c8247\u201d (positions: 0:8, 1:2, 2:4, 3:7) which returned 1 bull and 1 cow. One natural way to try to fit the pieces is to assume:\n\u2003\u2013 The bull from the {1,2,3} group is 2. Since in \u201c0123,\u201d if 2 is that bull it must be in position 2, so S2 = 2.\n\u2003\u2013 The bull from the {4,5,6} group can be 6 (since if 6 is the bull, it must be in position 3, so S3 = 6; note that if we took 4, it would conflict with the placement needed in guess \u201c8247\u201d).\n\u2003\u2013 That leaves the two digits from {7,8,9}. We already know one must go to S0. For guess \u201c8247,\u201d we see digits 8 and 7 belong to group3. Let\u2019s try S0 = 8 and S1 = 9. (Also note: in \u201c0789,\u201d 8 was in pos2 and 7 in pos? and 9 in pos3 \u2013 placing 8 at S0 and 9 at S1 avoids matching the positions as in guess \u201c0789.\u201d Also, S1 cannot be 7 because guess \u201c0789\u201d has 7 at pos1 and we got 0 bulls there.)\n\nWith that assignment the candidate secret becomes:\n\u2003S0 = 8, S1 = 9, S2 = 2, S3 = 6\u2003\u2192\u20038926\n\nLet\u2019s verify against all responses:\n\u2022 Guess \u201c0123\u201d: Common digit is 2 in position 2. (1 bull, 0 cows) \u2713\n\u2022 Guess \u201c0456\u201d: Common digit is 6 in position 3. (1 bull, 0 cows) \u2713\n\u2022 Guess \u201c0789\u201d: Common digits: 8 and 9. In \u201c0789\u201d 8 is at pos2 and 9 is at pos3, while in our secret 8 is at pos0 and 9 is at pos1. (0 bulls, 2 cows) \u2713\n\u2022 Guess \u201c8247\u201d: Compare positions:\n\u2003\u2013 pos0: guess 8 vs secret 8 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2013 pos1: guess 2 vs secret 9 \u2192 2 is in secret (at S2) \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Others do not match.\nThus (1 bull, 1 cow) \u2713\n\nEverything fits our deductions. Based on this, a very strong candidate for the secret is 8926.\n\nI will now guess 8926.\n\nGUESS: 8926"

(We already eliminated 0 because if 0 were correct, it would have produced a bull in the other guesses where it repeats.)\n\n3. Guess 0789 (0 bulls, 2 cows): In the set {7,8,9} (since 0 is eliminated) exactly two of these digits appear in the secret, but not in the positions they appear in this guess. (For example, if 7 appears, it cannot be in position1; if 8 appears, not in pos2; if 9 appears, not in pos3.)\n\n4. Guess 8247 (1 bull, 1 cow): Among these digits, exactly two are in the secret \u2013 one in the same position and one in a different position.\n\n5. Guess 8926 (2 bulls, 0 cows): In this guess (digits in positions: 0:8, 1:9, 2:2, 3:6), exactly two digits are correct and in the correct spots; the other two digits do not appear anywhere in the secret.\n\nA very promising line of reasoning is to try assigning the bull positions that seem to come naturally from earlier guesses. One productive assumption is as follows:\n\n\u2022 From Guess 8926: Suppose the bulls come from positions 0 and 3. That is, assume S0 = 8 and S3 = 6. Then digits 9 (pos1) and 2 (pos2) do not appear in the secret.\n  \n\u2022 Now, look at Guess 0123. Since 2 (pos2) is ruled out and we already eliminated 0 in earlier reasoning, the only possibility for its one bull is digit 1 in position1 (S1 = 1). So we set S1 = 1.\n\n\u2022 Next, consider Guess 0456. With 0 out and S3 now fixed as 6, we see that the one bull in that guess could be the 6 in position3. (Digits 4 and 5 then must be absent, which is consistent.)\n\n\u2022 Finally, turning to Guess 0789. Its digits (after eliminating 0) are (7,8,9). We already have 8 (in S0 = 8). Since exactly two of {7,8,9} must appear\u2014and 9 is excluded by Guess 8926\u2014we conclude that the other must be 7. It cannot be in the same position as in Guess 0789 (where 7 is in pos1), so 7 must go to the remaining slot S2.\n\nChecking all:\n\u2003\u2022 Secret candidate becomes: S0 = 8, S1 = 1, S2 = 7, S3 = 6 \u2192 Number 8176.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 0123: Only common digit is 1 at pos1 \u2192 1 bull, 0 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 0456: Only common digit is 6 at pos3 \u2192 1 bull, 0 cows.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 0789: Secret has 8 and 7.

Since only digits 7, 8, and 5 from that guess (ignoring 9, because 9 did not contribute to the count) come from our previously known candidate group, this tells us that exactly two of {7, 8, 5} are in the secret.\n\nFrom the second guess we know the secret contains three digits from {5,6,7,8}.

Matching their intersections shows that the secret almost certainly contains three digits in common between {5,6,7,8} and {0,6,7,8}\u2014namely 6, 7, plus one of 5 or 0. Testing with guess3 (7859) forced the conclusion that the common candidate set is actually {5,7} (from guess3) and then overall our working possibility becomes that the secret\u2019s digits are {0,5,6,7} in some order.

This would yield 0 bulls and 4 cows.\n\u2013 For secret = 8,0,5,6 (i.e. 8056), at least one digit will hit its position. In fact, comparing 0586 to 8056, the 6 in the units place would match, giving 1 bull (and the other three as cows).\nThus the feedback from 0586 will distinguish which ordering is correct.\n\nGUESS: 0586"

Thus the secret must have 5,6,8 and one extra digit. Later analysis and feedback pointed to the extra digit being 0.\n\n\u2022 In guess 7859 we got 1 bull and 1 cow. Since only 5 and 8 from that guess can be from our candidate set, that forces one of them to be in the correct place and the other to be in the secret but in a different position. We fix that by adopting case B of our possibilities\u2014that is, assume 5 is correct in its place from guess 7859 (which places 5 in position 3) and 8 appears but in a different position.\n\n\u2022 In guess 0678 (digits 0,6,7,8) with 0 bulls and 3 cows we learn that 0,6,8 are in the secret but none are in the guessed positions (so 0 cannot be position 1, 6 cannot be position 2, and 8 cannot be position 4).\n\n\u2022 In guess 7065 (digits 7,0,6,5, with common were 0,6,5) we got 1 bull and 2 cows. Given our placement from guess 7859 and knowing that in guess 7065 the only possibility for a bull is at position 2 (with digit 0) \u2014 (since pos3 in guess5 is 6 but we already fixed 5 in pos3 from guess3) \u2014 we deduce that 0 must be in position 2.\n\n\u2022 With all that, we are left with secret digits {0,5,6,8} and the following position constraints:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Position 2 must be 0.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In guess 7859, we needed 5 as bull in position 3 (since we chose case B).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 From guess 5678 and guess 0678, 8 cannot be in position 4. And with 0 in position 2 and 5 in position 3, the remaining digits 6 and 8 must go to positions 1 and 4. Since 8 cannot be pos4, 8 must go to position 1 and 6 to position 4.\n\nPutting it all together yields the secret ordering: Position 1: 8, Position 2: 0, Position 3: 5, Position 4: 6 (i.e. 8056).\n\nAll previous feedback now matches:\n\u2003\u2022 5678 yields 0 bulls and 3 cows (5,6,8 misplaced).\n\u2003\u2022 7859 yields 1 bull (position 3 is 5) and 1 cow (8 present but in pos1 instead of pos2).\n\u2003\u2022 0678 yields 0 bulls and 3 cows (0,6,8 are present but in different positions).\n\u2003\u2022 7065 yields 1 bull (0 in position2) and 2 cows (6 and 5 misplaced).\n\u2003\u2022 0586 yields 1 bull (6 in position4) and 3 cows (all digits present but only that single bull).\n\nThus the consistent candidate is 8056.\n\nMy next guess is:\n\nGUESS: 8056"

From the first guess (0123) we learned one digit among 0, 1, 2, 3 is in the secret number but not in the same position where it appeared. In our second guess (1456), we got one bull and no cows. That bull must be from the overlap with our first guess. Out of the digits 1, 4, 5, 6, the only candidate that was in the first guess is 1. Therefore, the secret number contains 1. In 0123, 1 was in the second position but as a cow it must be in a different spot; and in 1456, 1 was in the first position and that guess gave a bull. So we now know that the secret number has 1 in the first position. Furthermore, since guess 1456 resulted in no additional cows, none of 4, 5, or 6 are in the secret number. Also, from the first guess only one digit is correct, which we now know is 1. Thus, 0, 2, and 3 from that guess must be absent as well.\n\nThe digits eliminated so far are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

        "content": "We now know that our secret number does not include 1. Here\u2019s why:\n\u2022 In our first guess (0123) we got 0 bulls and 1 cow. That tells us exactly one digit from {0,1,2,3} is in the secret, but nothing is in the position it appears in 0123.\n\u2022 In our second guess (1456) we obtained 1 bull and 0 cows. That bull comes from one digit placed exactly right among {1,4,5,6} while none of the other three appears at all. If that bull were 1 then 1 would be in the secret\u2014but in that case the guess 0123 would have given a cow for 1 (since in 0123 the 1 is in position 2) and, later, using 1 again in 1789 (which yielded 1 bull,1 cow) would force too many copies from the overlap with {7,8,9} once we account for all four digits. Therefore it fits best that the bull in 1456 comes from one of {4,5,6} (which makes digit 1 absent).\n \nSo, digit 1 is out. That forces the cow from 0123 to come from {0,2,3} (exactly one of these appears in the secret). And from 1456 exactly one digit from {4,5,6} is in the secret (and in its correct position), while the other two are absent. Finally, look at our third guess (1789). It used 1 (which we now believe is absent) and digits from {7,8,9}. The feedback (1 bull, 1 cow) tells us that among {7,8,9} exactly 2 appear in the secret, with one in the correct position.\n \nThus the secret\u2019s four digits come from:\n\u2013 Exactly one from {0,2,3} \n\u2013 Exactly one from {4,5,6} (and its location is fixed by the corresponding position in 1456)\n\u2013 Exactly two from {7,8,9}\n \nOne plausible candidate is to take, for instance, the bull from 1456 as the digit 4 in position 2 (since guess 1456 is: pos1=1, pos2=4, pos3=5, pos4=6, and here pos2 must equal 4). Suppose we choose 2 from {0,2,3} and 7 and 8 from {7,8,9}. One arrangement that fits all our clues is:\n\u2003\u2003Position 1: 2\u2003\u2003(from {0,2,3} but placed so it does not conflict with its guess in 0123)\n\u2003\u2003Position 2: 4\u2003\u2003(correct placement from 1456 gives the bull)\n\u2003\u2003Position 3: 8\u2003\u2003(which will show as a bull in 1789 if 8 is guessed in pos3)\n\u2003\u2003Position 4: 7\u2003\u2003(then when guessing 1789, the digit 7 in position 2 of that guess will count as a cow)\n \nLet\u2019s check this candidate (2487) against the previous feedback:\n\u2022 Against 0123: Our candidate has 2 (and 2 appears in guess \u201c0123\u201d in pos3; here it is in pos1) \u2192 1 cow.\n\u2022 Against 1456: The candidate has 4 in pos2 (guess \u201c1456\u201d has 4 in pos2) \u2192 1 bull and none of the other digits appear.\n\u2022 Against 1789: Comparing 1789 to 2487:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos1: guess 1 versus 2 \u2192 no match.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos2: guess 7 versus 4 \u2192 no match, but 7 is in pos4 \u2192 counts as cow.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos3: guess 8 versus 8 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 pos4: guess 9 versus 7 \u2192 no match.\n\u2003Result: 1 bull and 1 cow, which matches.\n \nThis candidate fits all the clues perfectly.

We now consider which possibility fits all clues.  \n\u2022 Guess 3 (1789) resulted in 1 bull and 1 cow.

In that case, we must have secret\u2019s third digit = 5 and we exclude the other digits from guess 2 (1,4,6).  \n\u2022 With digit 5 fixed in position 3, guess 1 tells us one digit from {0,1,2,3} appears; since 1 is now excluded from the secret (from guess 2 if 1 isn\u2019t the bull) we are left with either 0, 2, or 3. Moreover, that digit must not be in the same position as in guess 1.  \n\u2022 Guess 3 involves digits {1,7,8,9} but 1 is excluded, so exactly two of {7,8,9} appear.  \n\u2022 Finally, guess 4 (2487) produced 0 bulls and 2 cows and contains the digits {2,4,8,7}. We already know that 4 is excluded (from guess 2 if 5 is the bull). Thus among 2,8,7, exactly two appear\u2014but none must be in the same position as in guess 4.\n\nA promising possibility is to take the one digit from {0,2,3} as 3 (and place it where guess 1\u2019s placement isn\u2019t repeated), and to choose the two digits from {7,8,9} as 7 and 8.

In guess 2, 5 is also at position 3, giving 1 bull, and none of the other digits (1,4,6) appear. This matches the 1 bull, 0 cows result.  \n\u2022 Guess 3 (1789): The candidate shares digits 7 and 8. In guess 3, digit 7 is in position 2, matching our candidate\u2019s position 2 (bull), and digit 8 is in position 3 in guess 3 but in position 4 in our candidate (cow).

That is, we set B = 7 and C = 5 (because in Guess 5, pos2 was 7 and pos3 was 5). Then the digits from Guess 5 in pos1 (3) and pos4 (8) must be absent in the secret.\n\nLet\u2019s check consistency with other guesses with these assumptions:\n\u2022 From Guess 2 (1456), having exactly one bull, the candidate bull is 5 in position 3 (since 1,4,6 must then be absent). So the secret includes 5 in position C = 5.\n\u2022 Guess 1 (0123) tells us one digit from {0,1,2,3} appears. Since 1 and 3 are now ruled out (3 was used in Guess 5 but we decided to exclude it), the only option is either 0 or 2. We will see which one fits.\n\u2022 From Guess 4 (2487), note that 4 and 8 we now exclude, leaving {2,7} as candidates. We already have 7 in the secret (at pos2) and we need one more. Thus the secret must include 2. Also the cow condition forces that the digit 2 cannot be in the same place it was in Guess 4 (which is pos1). So 2 must be placed in the only remaining available position, which is D (pos4) if we already have B and C assigned.\n\u2022 Finally, Guess 3 (1789) now: the digits in the guess, after excluding 1 (from Guess 2\u2019s elimination) and 8 (ruled out by Guess 5) are {7,9}. We already have 7 in pos2, but note that for Guess 3 the bull and cow come from among its digits. With 7 in pos2, if that were correct matching then it is a bull when comparing to Guess 3 (since in Guess 3, 7 is in position 2); then we need one more digit from {1,8,9} to be present. With 1 and 8 eliminated, we must have 9. The placement in Guess 3 for 9 is pos4, but we already plan to put 2 in pos4. Therefore, we can put 9 in the remaining free spot (which is pos1), and then assign 2 in pos4 based on the constraint from Guess 4.

Since guess 5162 contains {5,1,6,2} and the overlap with the first guess is {1,2}, we can let:\n\u2003\u2003p = number of digits from {1,2} in the secret,\n\u2003\u2003q = number of digits from {3,4} in the secret (from guess 1234),\nso that p + q = 2.\nAlso, from guess 5162, if we let r be the count from {5,6} (the digits new in guess 5162), then p + r = 2.\nThis system tells us that either:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 p = 2 (so the secret contains both 1 and 2, and then neither from {3,4} nor from {5,6} appears),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 or p = 0 (so the secret contains neither 1 nor 2, forcing it to contain both of {3,4} and both of {5,6} in order to satisfy 2 cows each\u2014but that would total 4 digits, making the secret exactly {3,4,5,6}),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 or p = 1 (so one digit from {1,2} is present, one from {3,4} is present, and one from {5,6} is present; the fourth digit must then come from the remaining digits not yet tried).\nTo help distinguish among these cases, it\u2019s useful to test the remaining digits that haven\u2019t appeared so far. The only digits not yet involved are 0, 7, 8, and 9. For example, if the secret\u2019s extra digits (beyond the two already identified from guess 1234) come from this set, then a guess of 7890 will give us useful insight.\n\u2022 If we get 0 cows from 7890 it strongly suggests that none of 0, 7, 8, 9 are in the secret. That in turn points toward the possibility that the secret consists solely of digits from our earlier guesses\u2014specifically, the secret might be {3,4,5,6} (with 3 and 4 from guess 1234 and 5 and 6 from guess 5162).\n\u2022 If we get 2 cows from 7890 then that would indicate that both extra digits (beyond the two from {1,2} in the possible p = 2 scenario) are among 7, 8, 9, 0.\n\u2022 A response of 1 cow would lean toward the p = 1 scenario where only one extra digit (apart from one digit among 1 or 2, one from {3,4} and one from {5,6}) is among these four.\nThus, guessing 7890 next should help us distinguish among the various candidate sets.\n\nGUESS: 7890"

This tells us that exactly two digits from {1, 2, 3, 4} are in the secret (but in different positions than in 1234).\n\u2022 Guess 2 (5162) returned 0 bulls and 2 cows. It contains {1, 2} (which are in common with guess 1) and {5, 6}. That tells us that the total number of secret digits from {1,2} plus the secret digits from {5,6} is 2.\n\u2022 Guess 3 (7890) returned 0 bulls and 1 cow. So exactly one digit from {7, 8, 9, 0} is in the secret.\n\nThe simplest solution consistent with all these clues is to assume that of the two secret digits coming from guess 1\u2019s set, one is from {1,2} and the other from {3,4} (so that the total from guess 1 is 1 + 1 = 2). Then, from guess 2 we\u2019d have (from its {1,2} portion) 1 digit plus exactly one digit from {5,6} giving 2. Finally, guess 3 tells us that one digit comes from {7,8,9,0}.\n\nThus the secret\u2019s four digits (in some order) come from:\n\u2003\u2022 one digit from {1, 2},\n\u2003\u2022 one digit from {3, 4},\n\u2003\u2022 one digit from {5, 6},\n\u2003\u2022 one digit from {7, 8, 9, 0}.\n\nWith this hypothesis in mind, my next guess should include one candidate from each of these groups while deliberately rearranging the positions to avoid placing a digit where it appeared in a previous guess (since none were bulls).\n\nLet\u2019s choose:\n\u2003\u2022 From {1,2}: 2\n\u2003\u2022 From {3,4}: 3\n\u2003\u2022 From {5,6}: 6\n\u2003\u2022 From {7,8,9,0}: 7\n\nNow, note the following position constraints from previous guesses:\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 1 (\u201c1234\u201d) implies if the secret has a 2 it cannot be in position 2 (because guess 1 had 2 in pos2) and if it has a 3 it cannot be in position 3.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 2 (\u201c5162\u201d) implies if the secret has a 6 it cannot be in position 3.\n\u2003\u2022 Guess 3 (\u201c7890\u201d) implies if the secret has a 7 it cannot be in position 1.\n\nI arrange these candidates in positions avoiding those conflicts. One possible arrangement is:\n\u2003Position 1: 2\u2003\u2003\u2003(position 1 had 1 before, so 2 is allowed)\n\u2003Position 2: 3\u2003\u2003\u2003(position 2 had 2, so 3 is fine)\n\u2003Position 3: 7\u2003\u2003\u2003(position 3 had 3 in guess 1 and 6 in guess 2; 7 is allowed)\n\u2003Position 4: 6\u2003\u2003\u2003(position 4 had 4 in guess 1 and 2 in guess 2; 6 is allowed)\n\nThis new guess \u201c2376\u201d will test our hypothesis by including one candidate from each group in new positions and should yield additional clues about which candidate is correct from each group.\n\nGUESS: 2376"

In order for all earlier responses to work out (namely, 2 digits from {1,2,3,4} in guess 1234 and 2 digits from {1,2,5,6} in guess 5162, plus 1 digit from {7,8,9,0} in guess 7890), the secret must contain one digit from each group\u2014but the candidates chosen for groups might be different from those we used in 2376.

In our recent guesses the \u201ccandidates\u201d we tried were A = 1 versus 2, B = 3 versus 4, C = 5 versus 6, and D = 7 versus 8 (since in guess5 the 8 did not work well). Comparing the feedback:\n\u2003\u2022 In guess4 (2376) the digits from these groups were 2 (A), 3 (B), 6 (C) and 7 (D). The result of 1 bull and 1 cow suggests that exactly two of these four chosen candidates are in the secret and one of them is in the right spot.\n\u2003\u2022 In guess5 (1468) the digits were 1 (A), 4 (B), 6 (C) and 8 (D) yet we got 0 bulls and only 1 cow\u2014so among these, exactly one candidate is present in the secret (and in a wrong position).\nIt seems the hit from guess5 came from trying 1 in group A, whereas in guess4 the hit may have come from 3 (group B) and/or 7 (group D). A likely candidate composition that makes things work is: \n\u2003Group A = 1, \n\u2003Group B = 3, \n\u2003Group C = 5, and \n\u2003Group D = 7.\n(This composition would be consistent with guess1 having two from {1,2,3,4} \u2013 here 1 and 3, with no digit in its original slot if we arrange the secret appropriately; with guess2 giving two hits from {1,5} if placed in different positions; and with guess3 returning one hit from 7.)\nWhile we have not yet determined the exact positions, a fruitful next step is to test this candidate set in a new ordering. I propose trying the guess 3715. By placing these four digits in a new order we check whether our composition\u2014and particular arrangement hints from past feedback\u2014can be confirmed or need adjustment.\n\nGUESS: 3715"

The feedback (1 bull and 1 cow) tells us that of these four, only 2 are in the secret.\n\u2022 In guess 5 (1468) the digits are: 1 from A, 4 from B, 6 from C, and 8 from D, and only one of these is in the secret.\n\u2022 In guess 6 (3715) the digits are: 3 (B), 7 (D), 1 (A) and 5 (C) with feedback of 1 bull and 1 cow.\nA self\u2013consistent solution to these \u201cmembership\u201d conditions turns out to be that the secret\u2019s digits are chosen as follows:\n\u2003Group A: 2\u2003\u2003(Group A must be 2 rather than 1)\n\u2003Group B: 4\u2003\u2003(Group B then is 4, not 3)\n\u2003Group C: 5\u2003\u2003(Group C is 5 rather than 6)\n\u2003Group D: 7\u2003\u2003(And Group D is 7 rather than 8 or another candidate)\nThus our secret candidate set is {2, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nThe next step is to \u201corder\u201d these four digits into positions that match all previous feedback. A trial ordering that fits all clues is:\n\u2003Position 1: 2\n\u2003Position 2: 7\n\u2003Position 3: 5\n\u2003Position 4: 4\n\nLet\u2019s quickly verify this candidate:\n\u2022 Guess 1 (1234): The secret (2,7,5,4) contains digits 2 and 4 from guess1. In guess1 the digit 2 appears at position 2 and 4 at position 4. In our secret, 2 is in pos1 and 4 in pos4. That gives no bull for the 2 and although 4 is in pos4 in secret as well as in guess1, that would have been a bull\u2014so we must check carefully. \n\u2003Actually, to satisfy guess1 (0 bulls, 2 cows) neither of the common digits should appear in the same position as in 1234. In 1234, 1 is pos1, 2 pos2, 3 pos3, 4 pos4. In our secret, 2 is pos1 (different from guess1\u2019s pos2) and 4 is pos4 (which would match guess1\u2019s pos4\u2014so that ordering would yield a bull).\nSo we adjust: we must avoid placing 4 from group B in position 4 (since guess1 digit 4 is pos4) and also avoid placing the chosen digit from group A in the same position as in guess2, etc.\n\nAfter testing different orders with the candidate set {2,4,5,7}, the ordering\n\u2003Secret: pos1 = 2, pos2 = 7, pos3 = 5, pos4 = 4\nnearly works with one inconsistency: In guess1 (1234) digit 4 would be in the same position (pos4) as our secret\u2019s digit 4.

We need 1 bull,1 cow.\nTo fix guess6, we need one of the two (7 or 5) not to fall in the same position. In guess6, 7 is pos2 and 5 is pos4. We already have secret: 7 in pos2, 5 in pos4. So if we swap 4 and 5, consider secret: pos1 = 2, pos2 = 7, pos3 = 5, pos4 = 4.\nWe already attempted that earlier and got a problem with guess4: \nCheck guess4 for secret (2,7,5,4):\n\u2003Guess4 (2376): \n\u2003\u20032: pos1 \u2192 secret pos1=2, bull.\n\u2003\u20037: guess4 pos3 vs secret pos2=7, cow.\n= 1 bull,1 cow, good.\nNow recheck guess6 with secret (2,7,5,4):\nGuess6 (3715):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {7,5}:\n\u2003\u20037: guess6 pos2 vs secret pos2: bull.\n\u2003\u20035: guess6 pos4? Actually guess6 is 3 (pos1), 7 (pos2), 1 (pos3), 5 (pos4).\n\u2003\u2003Secret has 5 in pos3 (not pos4) \u2192 cow.\nThat gives 1 bull,1 cow, which is our target.\nNow reverify all quickly:\nGuess1: (1234) vs (2,7,5,4): Intersection {2,4}: 2 is in secret pos1 vs guess pos2 \u2192 cow; 4 is in secret pos4 vs guess pos4 \u2192 bull? Wait, guess1: digit 4 is placed at pos4 in guess1, and secret pos4=4. That yields a bull \u2013 but guess1 must be 0 bulls.\nSo secret (2,7,5,4) gives a bull for guess1 because guess1's fourth digit is 4 and secret's fourth digit is 4. \nThus we must avoid matching the position for the digit that appears in guess1. In guess1, digits are 1 (pos1), 2 (pos2), 3 (pos3), 4 (pos4). So if secret contains 2 and 4, we must not place 2 in pos2 and 4 in pos4.\nOur current secret (2,7,5,4) has 2 in pos1 (good, since guess1 had 2 in pos2) but 4 in pos4 (bad because guess1 pos4 is 4). So swap 4 with a non\u2013guess1 \u201cdanger\u201d position among our two digits. We can try: secret: pos1 = 2, pos2 = 7, pos3 = 4, pos4 = 5 failed for guess6?

In guess6, the digits are 3,7,1,5 (positions 1,2,3,4). In our candidate, we have 7 and 5. To get only one bull, only one of these two should be in its same position.

Let\u2019s recheck guess1\u20135 for secret = 4,7,2,5:\nGuess1: 1234 vs (4,7,2,5):\n\u2003\u2013 {2,4}: 4 is at pos1 vs guess1 pos4 (cow); 2 is at pos3 vs guess1 pos2 (cow) \u2192 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess2: 5162 vs (4,7,2,5):\n\u2003\u2013 {5,2}: 5 is at pos4 vs guess2 pos1 (cow); 2 is at pos3 vs guess2 pos4 (cow) \u2192 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess3: 7890 vs (4,7,2,5):\n\u2003\u2013 {7}: 7 is at pos2 vs guess3 pos1 (cow) \u2192 0 bulls,1 cow.\nGuess4: 2376 vs (4,7,2,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {2,7}:\n\u2003\u2003Possible bull if one digit is in the same position as guess4.\n\u2003\u2003Guess4: pos1=2, pos3=7.\n\u2003\u2003In secret: 2 is pos3 (matches guess4\u2019s pos1?

To fix guess6, we want either 7 or 5 to move so that one of them is out of position relative to guess6 (3715, with 7 in pos2, 5 in pos4). If we swap 7 and 5 in secret = 2,7,5,4 we already considered that: 2,5,7,4.\nRecheck secret = 2,5,7,4:\nGuess1: 1234 vs (2,5,7,4):\n\u2003\u2013 {2,4}: 2: guess1 pos2 vs secret pos1 (cow); 4: guess1 pos4 vs secret pos4 (bull) \u2192 1 bull,1 cow, but need 0 bulls,2 cows.\nThus, that ordering fails at guess1.\nThus the only ordering that made guesses 1\u20135 all check out was secret = 2,7,? and then we have trouble with guess6. Let\u2019s reexamine guess6 (3715, 1 bull and 1 cow) under the assumption that the candidate digits are indeed {2,4,5,7}. In guess6, the digits present from our candidate set are 7 and 5 (since 3,1 are not in our set and neither is 2 or 4 from guess6). For guess6 to return 1 bull and 1 cow, only one of 7 or 5 should be placed in the same position as in guess6 compared to the secret. In guess6, 7 is in position2 and 5 is in position4.\nOur previous ordering secret = 2,7,5,4 gives 7 in pos2 (bull) and 5 in pos3 compared to guess6\u2019s 5 in pos4 (cow). That would yield 1 bull and 1 cow \u2013 except we earlier noticed a problem with guess1 due to the digit 4 in pos4. Let\u2019s reverify secret = 2,7,5,4 one final time very carefully:\nSecret = \nPosition1: 2\nPosition2: 7\nPosition3: 5\nPosition4: 4\n\nGuess1: 1234\n\u2003Digits: 1,2,3,4.\n\u2003Secret common: 2 and 4.\n\u2003\u2013 2 is in secret pos1 vs guess1 pos2 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 4 is in secret pos4 vs guess1 pos4 \u2192 bull.\nThat gives 1 bull,1 cow but required 0 bulls,2 cows.\nSo if we swap positions 3 and 4: secret = 2,7,4,5:\nWe already rechecked:\nGuess1: 1234 vs (2,7,4,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {2,4}:\n\u2003\u20032: secret pos1 vs guess1 pos2 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u20034: secret pos3 vs guess1 pos4 \u2192 cow.\n\u2192 0 bulls,2 cows. Good.\nGuess2: 5162 vs (2,7,4,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {5,2}:\n\u2003\u20035: secret pos4 vs guess2 pos1 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u20032: secret pos1 vs guess2 pos4 \u2192 cow.\n\u2192 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess3: 7890 vs (2,7,4,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {7}:\n\u2003\u20037: secret pos2 vs guess3 pos1 \u2192 cow.\n\u2192 0 bulls,1 cow.\nGuess4: 2376 vs (2,7,4,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {2,7}:\n\u2003\u20032: guess4 pos1 vs secret pos1=2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u20037: guess4 pos3 vs secret pos2=7 \u2192 cow.\n\u2192 1 bull,1 cow.\nGuess5: 1468 vs (2,7,4,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {4}:\n\u2003\u20034: guess5 pos2 vs secret pos3=4 \u2192 cow.\n\u2192 0 bulls,1 cow.\nGuess6: 3715 vs (2,7,4,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {7,5}:\n\u2003\u20037: guess6 pos2 vs secret pos2=7 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u20035: guess6 pos4 vs secret pos4=5 \u2192 bull.\n\u2192 2 bulls,0 cows.\nThus, the only problematic guess is guess6.\nTo fix guess6, we want one of 7 or 5 to be moved. If we try secret = 2,7,5,4, we get guess1 conflict; if we try secret = 2,7,4,5 we saw guess6 conflict. What if we switch the candidate from group C from 5 to 6? That is, consider secret set {2,4,6,7} instead. Then check the earlier guesses:\nGuess1 (1234): Intersection with {2,4,6,7} is {2,4} \u2192 must yield 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess2 (5162): Intersection with {2,4,6,7} is {6,2} \u2192 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess3 (7890): Intersection with {2,4,6,7} is {7} \u2192 0 bulls,1 cow.\nGuess4 (2376): Intersection with {2,4,6,7} from guess4 (2,3,7,6) is {2,7,6}? That\u2019s three digits if secret contains 6 and 7 and 2. But secret must have exactly one from group A ({1,2}) and one from group C ({5,6}). If we now choose 6 for group C and 2 for group A, then guess2 (5162: {5,1,6,2}) intersection is {6,2} which is 2, okay. And for guess1 (1234) intersection is {2,4} if we choose 4 for group B. And group D from guess3 remains 7. Then secret set is {2,4,6,7}.\nNow check each guess if we can find an ordering.\nGuess1: 1234: common: {2,4} \u2192 should be 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess2: 5162: common: {6,2} \u2192 should be 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess3: 7890: common: {7} \u2192 0 bulls,1 cow.\nGuess4: 2376 (digits: 2,3,7,6): intersection with secret {2,4,6,7} is {2,7,6} \u2013 that\u2019s 3 digits, but feedback is 1 bull,1 cow, which totals 2. So that cannot be.\nThus the candidate from group C should be 5, not 6.\nWhat if we switch the candidate from group A from 2 to 1? That gives secret set {1,4,5,7}. Then:\nGuess1 (1234): Intersection with {1,4,5,7} is {1,4} \u2192 must be 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess2 (5162): Intersection with {1,4,5,7} is {1,5} \u2192 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess3 (7890): Intersection with {1,4,5,7} is {7} \u2192 0 bulls,1 cow.\nGuess4 (2376): Intersection with {1,4,5,7} is {7} (since 2 and 3 are not in secret, 7 is, and 6 is not) \u2192 so that would yield either 0 bulls,1 cow or 1 bull if positions match; feedback is 1 bull,1 cow (total 2) \u2013 so that doesn\u2019t match.\nThus, the only viable candidate set from our earlier analysis appears to be {2,4,5,7}; the only difficulty is arranging the order so that guess6 (3715) yields 1 bull,1 cow, while all other guesses are satisfied.\nConsider one more possibility: secret = 2,4,7,5 gives guess1: Intersection {2,4}:\n\u2003\u2013 2: secret pos1 vs guess1 pos2 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 4: secret pos2 vs guess1 pos4 \u2192 cow.\n(0 bulls,2 cows) good.\nGuess2 (5162) vs (2,4,7,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection {5,2}: \n\u2003\u20035: secret pos4 vs guess pos1 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u20032: secret pos1 vs guess pos4 \u2192 cow.\n(0 bulls,2 cows) good.\nGuess3 (7890) vs (2,4,7,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection {7}:\n\u2003\u20037: secret pos3 vs guess pos1 \u2192 cow.\n(0 bulls,1 cow) good.\nGuess4 (2376) vs (2,4,7,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection {2,7}:\n\u2003\u20032: guess4 pos1 vs secret pos1=2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u20037: guess4 pos3 vs secret pos3=7 \u2192 bull.\nThat yields 2 bulls,0 cows. We need 1 bull,1 cow.\nWhat if we try secret = 2,4,5,7 (which we already tried) gave guess4: 1 bull,1 cow and everything else except guess6 was okay, with guess6 = (3715) giving 2 bulls.\nNow, in guess6 (3715): digits by position: pos1:3, pos2:7, pos3:1, pos4:5.\nFor secret = 2,7,5,4 we had:\n\u20037 in secret at pos2 matches guess6 pos2 (bull);\n\u20035 in secret at pos3 vs guess6 pos4 \u2192 cow;\n\u2003Total: 1 bull,1 cow.\nBut then guess1 had a problem because secret digit 4 (in pos4) matches guess1 pos4.\nWhat if we rotate cyclically: secret = 7,5,4,2.\nCheck:\nGuess1 (1234) vs (7,5,4,2):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection with {1,2,3,4}: digits {4,2}.\n\u2003\u20034: guess1 pos4 vs secret pos3 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u20032: guess1 pos2 vs secret pos4 \u2192 cow.\n= 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess2 (5162) vs (7,5,4,2):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection with {5,1,6,2}: digits {5,2}.\n\u2003\u20035: guess2 pos1 vs secret pos2=5 \u2192 bull? (pos1 vs pos2 gives cow actually)\n\u2003\u20032: guess2 pos4 vs secret pos4=2 \u2192 bull.\nThat yields 2 bulls,0 cows, not allowed.\nTry secret = 7,4,2,5.\nGuess1: 1234 vs (7,4,2,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {2,4}: \n\u2003\u20034: guess1 pos4 vs secret pos2 \u2192 cow;\n\u2003\u20032: guess1 pos2 vs secret pos3 \u2192 cow.\n0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess2: 5162 vs (7,4,2,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {5,2}: \n\u2003\u20032: guess2 pos4 vs secret pos3=2 \u2192 cow;\n\u2003\u20035: guess2 pos1 vs secret pos4=5 \u2192 cow.\n0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess3: 7890 vs (7,4,2,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {7}: \n\u2003\u20037: guess3 pos1 vs secret pos1=7 \u2192 bull (should be cow).\nSo that fails.\nTry secret = 5,2,7,4.\nGuess1: 1234 vs (5,2,7,4):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {2,4}: \n\u2003\u20032: guess1 pos2 vs secret pos2=2 \u2192 bull (not allowed).\nThus, after numerous re-orderings, the arrangement that best fits all clues is secret = 2,7,4,5 except for guess6 giving 2 bulls. However, note that our earlier careful check with secret = 2,7,4,5 produced:\n\u2003Guess4: 2376 \u2192 1 bull,1 cow (if 2 in pos1 bull, 7 in pos? Let's recalc for secret = 2,7,4,5 exactly:)\nPositions: secret: pos1=2, pos2=7, pos3=4, pos4=5.\nGuess4 (2376): digits: pos1=2, pos2=3, pos3=7, pos4=6.\n\u2003\u2013 Compare: pos1: 2 vs secret pos1=2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2013 7 is in secret pos2 but guess4 pos3=7 \u2192 cow.\nSo guess4 is 1 bull,1 cow.\nGuess6 (3715): digits: pos1=3, pos2=7, pos3=1, pos4=5.\n\u2003\u2013 Compare: 7: guess6 pos2 vs secret pos2=7 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u2013 5: guess6 pos4 vs secret pos4=5 \u2192 bull.\nSo guess6 becomes 2 bulls,0 cows.\nWe need to \u201close\u201d one bull on guess6. That can be achieved if we move either 7 or 5 to a different position than pos2 or pos4, respectively. \nIf we swap the 7 and 4 in secret = 2,7,4,5, we get secret = 2,4,7,5.\nRecheck:\nGuess1: 1234 vs (2,4,7,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {2,4}:\n\u2003\u20032: guess1 pos2 vs secret pos1 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u20034: guess1 pos4 vs secret pos2 \u2192 cow.\n= 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess2: 5162 vs (2,4,7,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {5,2}:\n\u2003\u20032: guess2 pos4 vs secret pos1 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u20035: guess2 pos1 vs secret pos4 \u2192 cow.\n= 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess3: 7890 vs (2,4,7,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {7}:\n\u2003\u20037: guess3 pos1 vs secret pos3=7 \u2192 cow.\n= 0 bulls,1 cow.\nGuess4: 2376 vs (2,4,7,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {2,7}:\n\u2003\u20032: guess4 pos1 vs secret pos1=2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u20037: guess4 pos3 vs secret pos3=7 \u2192 bull.\n= 2 bulls,0 cows. (We need 1 bull,1 cow.)\nThus secret = 2,4,7,5 gives guess4 as 2 bulls.\nMaybe try secret = 2,4,5,7.\nWe already did that:\nGuess1: 1234 vs (2,4,5,7):\n\u2003\u2013 {2,4}:\n\u2003\u20032: guess1 pos2 vs secret pos1 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u20034: guess1 pos4 vs secret pos2 \u2192 cow.\n= 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess2: 5162 vs (2,4,5,7):\n\u2003\u2013 {5,2}:\n\u2003\u20035: guess2 pos1 vs secret pos3 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u20032: guess2 pos4 vs secret pos1 \u2192 cow.\n= 0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess3: 7890 vs (2,4,5,7):\n\u2003\u2013 {7}: cow.\nGuess4: 2376 vs (2,4,5,7):\n\u2003\u2013 {2,7}:\n\u2003\u20032: guess4 pos1 vs secret pos1=2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u20037: guess4 pos3?

So that fails.\nIf we swap 4 and 5 in secret = 2,4,5,7 we get 2,5,4,7, which we already checked:\nGuess1: 1234 vs (2,5,4,7):\n\u2003\u2013 {2,4}:\n\u2003\u20032: guess1 pos2 vs secret pos1 (cow);\n\u2003\u20034: guess1 pos4 vs secret pos3 (cow);\n=0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess2: 5162 vs (2,5,4,7):\n\u2003\u2013 {5,2}:\n\u2003\u20035: guess2 pos1 vs secret pos2 (cow);\n\u2003\u20032: guess2 pos4 vs secret pos1 (cow);\n=0 bulls,2 cows.\nGuess3: 7890 vs (2,5,4,7):\n\u2003\u2013 {7}: cow.\nGuess4: 2376 vs (2,5,4,7):\n\u2003\u2013 {2,7}:\n\u2003\u20032: guess4 pos1 vs secret pos1=2 \u2192 bull.\n\u2003\u20037: guess4 pos3 vs secret pos4=7 ? \u2192 cow.\n= 1 bull,1 cow.\nGuess5: 1468 vs (2,5,4,7):\n\u2003\u2013 {4}:\n\u2003\u20034: guess5 pos2 vs secret pos3=4 \u2192 cow.\n= 0 bulls,1 cow.\nGuess6: 3715 vs (2,5,4,7):\n\u2003\u2013 Intersection: {7,5}:\n\u2003\u20037: guess6 pos2 vs secret pos4=7? (secret: pos1=2, pos2=5, pos3=4, pos4=7) so 7 is in pos4, guess6 has 7 in pos2 \u2192 cow.\n\u2003\u20035: guess6 pos4 vs secret pos2=5 \u2192 cow.\nThat yields 0 bulls,2 cows (we need 1 bull,1 cow).\n\nIt appears that every ordering of {2,4,5,7} we attempt fails on one guess or another. Given the feedback, one particularly consistent candidate ordering is challenging. However, the analysis strongly indicates that the secret\u2019s four digits are 2, 4, 5, and 7. To break the symmetry and resolve the ordering ambiguity, my next guess will be one of the promising candidate orderings. \n\nBased on our deductions and trying to improve the information from guess6, I will try the guess 2547. (This corresponds to secret candidate ordering: pos1=2, pos2=5, pos3=4, pos4=7.)\n\nGUESS: 2547"

Here\u2019s a summary:\n\n\u2022 From guess 1 (1234 \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows) we know exactly two digits from {1,2,3,4} appear, and they are misplaced.\n\u2022 From guess 2 (5162 \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows) exactly two of {5,1,6,2} appear.\n\u2022 From guess 3 (7890 \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow) exactly one digit from {7,8,9,0} appears.\n\u2022 From guess 4 (2376 \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow) we learn that among the two shared digits with our candidates from guess 1\u2014that is, one from {1,2} and one from {3,4}\u2014one is in the correct position.\n\u2022 Guess 5 (1468 \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow) implies that only one digit among {1,4,6,8} is in the secret.\n\u2022 Guess 6 (3715 \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow) tells us that exactly two digits among {3,7,1,5} occur.\n\u2022 Finally, guess \u201c2547\u201d (0 bulls, 2 cows) shows that only two of its digits occur.\n\nA reasonable partition (supported by our earlier analysis) is that the secret\u2019s digits come one each from these groups:\n\u2003\u2013 Group A: {1,2} (from the overlap of guesses 1 and 2)\n\u2003\u2013 Group B: {3,4} (from guess 1)\n\u2003\u2013 Group C: {5,6} (from guess 2)\n\u2003\u2013 Group D: {7,8,9,0} (from guess 3)\n\nMatching the feedback from guess \u201c2547\u201d (which contains 2,5,4,7) forces the count of correctly chosen candidate values to be exactly 2. One consistent possibility is to have:\n\u2003a = 2 (from Group A),\n\u2003b = 3 (from Group B is forced because if we chose 4 too many of the guess \u201c2547\u201d digits would appear),\n\u2003c = 5 (from Group C),\n\u2003d = 8 (from Group D, also supported by guess 5 which contributes an 8).\nSo our candidate set becomes {2,3,5,8}.\n\nThen, by considering the positional restrictions from all guesses (for example, guess 1\u2019s digits 1\u20112\u20113\u20114 force that if 2 and 3 are the ones from Group A and B then they cannot sit in the positions where they appear in \u201c1234\u201d; similarly for the other guesses), one ordering that satisfies all feedback turns out to be:\n\u2003Position 1: 8\n\u2003Position 2: 3\n\u2003Position 3: 2\n\u2003Position 4: 5\n\nA quick check:\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 1 (1234): secret (8,3,2,5) shares 2 and 3; 2 is not in pos2 and 3 is not in pos3 \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 2 (5162): shares 5 and 2; neither is in its original place \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 3 (7890): shares 8 only, and it\u2019s misplaced \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 4 (2376): shares 2 and 3; here 3 (guess4\u2019s second digit) is in secret pos2 (bull) while 2 is in a different position (cow) \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 5 (1468): only 8 is common and is in the wrong position \u2192 0 bulls, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess 6 (3715): shares 3 and 5; here 5 (guess6\u2019s fourth digit) matches secret pos4 (bull) and 3 is in a different slot \u2192 1 bull, 1 cow.\n\u2003\u2013 Guess \u201c2547\u201d: shares 2 and 5; neither is in the same position (2 is in secret pos3 versus guess pos1; 5 is in secret pos4 versus guess pos2) \u2192 0 bulls, 2 cows.\n\nAll feedback is consistent with secret = 8,3,2,5.\n\nWith that in mind, my next guess, aiming to be the secret, is:\n\nGUESS: 8325"
