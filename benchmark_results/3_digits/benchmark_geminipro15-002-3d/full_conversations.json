Since swapping the 4 for 5 reduced the number of bulls from 2 to 1 and gave us no cows, it means that both 1 and 4 aren't in the answer so our answer must be of the form 3xx. Since our earlier guess of 123 gave us one cow it means that 2 must be present but not in the second place, therefore the final answer has to be 3x2. The other cow resulting from 123 must've been from the 2, meaning that our last guess can be 362. (we've tried 315, and we know that one such possibility for our case was 3_2).\nGUESS: 362\n"

Our most recent query gave us 1 misplaced cow suggesting that 1 should be at the final position, _ _ 1. Since 362 gave us no bulls and 1 cow, and we know that both positions besides the final position contain no 2, 6 (making them incorrect) and 3 cannot be the initial position, therefore 3_2 gives us two possible solutions for our solution remaining so far 3_1. from  381 we know that both 3 and 8 are both also incorrect meaning that the only other remaining possible digits are 0, 7 and 9 since our other guesses so far were 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.  3 cannot be a front number because the 0 bulls returned for 381. Since 1 is displaced also, our answer can now only be of the form _ _ 1.  Since the digit 2 resulted in one cow previously and returned 0 cows for 372, besides the cow for 1 returned also in 381 which didn't contain 2, we know that 2 is the other digit. Therefore, the solutions is therefore one of 2 and some other number where that number could be 7, 9 and 0 since 7 gave us 0 cows and bulls in a previous answer. This leaves only 0 and 9 unchecked. Giving us 291 or 201 as possibilities remaining. The only cow provided came from 2, since both 3 and 8 were both considered wrong. Thus leaving only 901, and some digit besides 8 since it resulted in 0b 0c for 372. Meaning there is no 8 and no 7. There's only 9 remaining.\n\n\nLets start with 291\nGUESS: 291\n"

Our earlier guess of 314 gives us our answer since 291 gave us 0 bulls and 1 cow. \n\nIf our actual answer starts with 31, and 291 is our guess that resulted in 0 bulls and 1 cow, we know that 31x has to be our possible answer where x is not equal to 5, 6, or 4 as confirmed since x in position for 31x was 4 earlier which gave us 2 bulls. Where as replacing 4 with 5 returned us 1 bull and replacing 4 with 6 returned us 1 bull also. Therefore, since 2, 9 and 1 result in 0b and 1 cow, we know that the potential numbers remaining include 291 and 312, therefore, since we know that the first query for 123 gave us 1 cow, that confirms 2 must be present, therefore our answer has to be 312\n\n\nGUESS: 312\n"

Both 1 and 2 both misplaced since no cows.)\n\nSo, 3 is correct in the first position due to 314 and 315. 1 and 2 are in the solution but not in the positions tried so far.  316 tells us that 3 is in the correct position, and one of 1 or 6 (but not both because only 1 cow) are in the wrong position. This hints that 1 is the other correct digit misplaced amongst 316. The fact there was 0 cows for 312, combined with 314's 2 bulls tells us that placing 2 at the end of 31_ must be incorrect given 312 resulted in 1 bull and not more then 1 bull despite 314 resulting in 2 bulls and 0 cows. Thus therefore our number must be 3_1 since the other correct digit must either be 1 or 6 due to the combination of 314 and 316. If we placed 6 at end to get 3_6 we would get our remaining possible solution thus far. From prior solutions we can conclude that the possible values remaining include 7, 9, and 0.  Since 372 returned 0 bulls and also 8 resulted in 0b when replaced with 7 where 7 replaced 6 when we got 0 bulls in total after having tried 362 and gotten 1 cow due to 2, our number must include 0 and 9. Having established that 3 must be the start we can conclude that either 301 or 391 is correct. Since 362 contains 0b 1c despite there being no shared digits besides 6, the 2 being present elsewhere, and 362 yielding no bulls despite 6 not being the cow, and also 3 resulting in no bull when 381 had 0 bulls, therefore since 312 resulted in 1 bull and 0 cows despite 314 returning 2b and 0c our solution is therefore 301 or 391 since 372 eliminated 7 as a possibility therefore since the digits we know we can use include only 0, 1 and maybe 9, this eliminates 2 and 6 and 5 based on past answers having attempted similar guesses.\n\nGUESS: 391\n"

This confirms the 3 is correct, and tells us 5 is not the last digit.\n\n3. **312:** 1 bull. This *also* confirms 3 is correct.

Let's rethink.\n\nFrom 210, we have 1 bull therefore it contains a 2, 1, or 0.  From 025, we have 2 cows so we have 2 and 5 in wrong spots meaning 0 is also incorrect. From 314, we have 1 bull, therefore we have 3, 1, or 4.  Given 3 isn't a possibility, 1 or 4 could be there and we still have 3 as a possible digit. Then 356 ruled that 5 and 6 are not present, so at least one of the digits in 1, 2 and 4 must be present. Lets assume for now the correct solution must contain 1, 2, and 4. My first guess contained a cow with 123, so 3 cannot be in the secret number.\n\nThat would make the logic from 314 that 1 or 4 are present invalid since we already know from guess 123 that only one of those numbers would be included.

Since 456 got BULLS=1 and COWS=1, 4_5 didn't give correct answer either. Thus _4_ with 6 and 5 on either sides yielded 2 or 1 COWS. When 549 was tried it yielded BULLS = 1, meaning 5 cannot be the first digit and 9 is not part of the number. 4_6 or _46 remains same. Now trying 5 again gives us that trying 5 is wrong thus making _4_ with only 6 as an option with 0 as an untried number. Thus _46. 456 got 1,1 means that _46 is the answer with 0 on the left making 046 the final guess.
