This suggests that the digit 9 might not be in the number because a cow can appear in this guess but not 159 which has 0 cows.\n\nWith the single cow being present with the digit 5 or 'other digit not shown', my next step is to pick a digit other than 5 or 9 that hasn't been previously used (in use 1 and digits to which 1 is filled, and the digits 0 3 4 are also not in use). My guess for the remaining numbers are 275."

Another 2 digit possibilities appear at 8's 'guess'.  Guess has '3' that gives one digit to not replace number '1'.\n\nTherefore my next guess is GUESS: 548"

We now know the digit '9' is in the number.\n\nGiven that I have reliable information about the presence of '9', I'll first ensure that it remains in its current position, swap out the other 'known' digits that appeared in my previous guesses that contributed to a cow (7 and 2, which is 72), and assign the digits to their likely correct positions around '9'.
