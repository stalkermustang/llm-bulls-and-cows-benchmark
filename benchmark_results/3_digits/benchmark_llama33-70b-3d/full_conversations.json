Let's try to combine this information: I'll keep 8, introduce 5 back into the mix (since it was a bull once), and add a new digit, 2, which hasn't been tried with 8 and 5 yet.\n\nGUESS: 852"

This outcome is significant because it suggests that we are close to the correct solution, given the combination of a bull and a cow.\n\nConsidering the history of the game, '0' has been a persistent presence in guesses that resulted in bulls, suggesting it could be part of the secret number. The fact that 064 resulted in 1 bull and 1 cow indicates that the combination or the position of the digits in this guess is partially correct.\n\nGiven that '6' was part of the guesses 069 and 067, both of which had 1 bull and 0 cows, and now '6' is part of a guess with 1 bull and 1 cow, it's possible that '6' is the bull in the correct position. The presence of '4', which was part of the initial guess 014 that had 0 bulls and 1 cow, and now part of 064 with 1 bull and 1 cow, suggests that '4' could be the cow in the wrong position.\n\nMy next strategy will be to build on this information by keeping '6' in the same position (as it's likely the bull) and rearranging or introducing new digits to find the correct combination for the other two positions.\n\nGUESS: 065"

However, since '0' cannot be the first digit of a 3-digit number and we have 2 bulls, it suggests that '0' cannot be one of the two correct digits in the correct position if it were in the first position, which was not the case here since I started with '014'. Thus, considering the rules and the result, it's likely that '1' is one of the correct digits in the correct position, and either '0' or '4' could be the other, given the constraints.\n\nConsidering the constraints and trying to utilize the information about 2 bulls efficiently, my next guess should maintain the correct positioning of the two correct digits while exploring other possibilities for the third digit. Since we cannot repeat digits and '1' and '0' (or '4') are already used, my next guess will involve changing the third digit to something not yet tried, keeping in mind the secret number does not include repeating digits.\n\nGiven the above logic and the need to introduce a new digit that hasn't been tried yet (to avoid repetition), I'll introduce the digit '2', which hasn't been used.

This is a critical piece of information because it confirms that the secret number consists of the digits 8, 7, and 2, but the positions are incorrect.\n\nGiven this, the next step is to rearrange these digits to find the correct order. Since we have all three cows (indicating all digits are present but misplaced), we can try different permutations of 8, 7, and 2 to find the correct combination.\n\nOne of the possible permutations is to arrange them in a different order. Considering the previous guesses and the fact that 2 has historically been a correct digit in a certain position, it's possible that 2 might not be the first digit. Therefore, trying a permutation where 2 is not the first digit could be insightful.\n\nGUESS: 728"
