Considering we guessed 1 in the middle before without success, let's try a new digit.\n\nAs we are confident in 4 being the first and 6 being the third digit, let's try another new digit in the middle position.

Reflecting on all feedback, perhaps the assumption about 6 was correct only under particular conditions.\n\nGiven that 476 gave us 1 bull in either the first or third position previously and reverting to check if perhaps 4 and 6 may have landed wrong after all, I will try maintaining 4 and replacing both the second and third digits.
