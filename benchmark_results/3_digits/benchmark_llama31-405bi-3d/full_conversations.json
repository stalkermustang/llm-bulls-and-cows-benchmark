And since '5' had no effect on bulls or cows, a simple plan is to hold two values in place as likely providers of the '2 Bulls' and pick another one to see an outcome where it's least disrupting known outcomes.\n\nBut let\u2019s be strategic to change for an optimal exploration with as much information; to start exploring, '6', being the middle range option from unused sets seems likely as it was never presented and fits if aiming within mid-range with digits remaining, providing feedback while retaining information from \u201823.\n\nGUESS: 236"

This suggests that my attempt to find the correct position for the third digit (0) was not successful, and I may have misinterpreted the clue.\n\nGiven this outcome, I need to reevaluate my understanding of the game's state. I previously had 2 bulls with the guess 640, and now I have 0 bulls and 2 cows with the guess 064. This implies that the correct positions of the digits 6 and 4 are likely in the guess 640, but the position of 0 is still uncertain.\n\nSince my previous guess of 640 was close, with 2 bulls, my next guess should aim to make a minimal adjustment to this guess, while trying to find the correct position for the third digit (0). However, considering I've already tried placing 0 at the beginning (064) and lost the 2 bulls, I should explore other possibilities.\n\nGiven the guess 640 had 2 bulls, and I don't want to disrupt the correct positions of 6 and 4, my next guess is to place 0 in the middle position, hoping to find the correct arrangement of all three digits.\n\nGUESS: 604"

        "content": "With 1 bull and 1 cow, I've made significant progress. This result suggests that one of the digits from 528 is in the correct position, and another digit is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nGiven that I previously had 0 bulls and 1 cow with the guesses 059 and 057, and now I have 1 bull and 1 cow with 528, it's possible that the digit 5 is the one that's correct and in the right position. This is because the 5 is the common digit among these guesses.\n\nAssuming the 5 is the correct digit in the right position, I'll try to build upon this by adjusting the positions of the other digits. I'll swap the 2 and 8 to see if the correct but misplaced digit is one of these.\n\nHowever, I must also consider the possibility that the correct but misplaced digit is not the 2 or 8. In this case, I'll make a new guess with the 5 in the same position, and introduce a new combination that can help me gather more information.\n\nSince I am assuming digit 5 is correct and it already was in the middle, I can re-use 2 or 8 in a different combination. This time I will retain 5's place but this time re-introduce digit 0 that I used previously to check its validity again in a new composition.\n\nGUESS: 508"

To further investigate, I'll try to utilize the 0 in a different combination while keeping the 5 in the same position.\n\nThis time, I'll introduce a new digit to pair with the 0 and 5.

I'll bring back the digit 8, which I used in the guess 528 that resulted in 1 bull and 1 cow. I'll pair the 8 with the 5, which I'll keep in the same position, and introduce a new digit to complete the combination.\n\nThis time, I'll choose the digit 6, which I haven't used before.
