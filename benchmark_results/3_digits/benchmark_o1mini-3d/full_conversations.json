Since there are 0 bulls, **1** cannot be in position 2 or 1, but from the second guess, **1** is likely correctly placed in position 1. This suggests that **0** and **3** are the two cows, meaning they are present but not in their guessed positions.\n- From the fourth and fifth guesses (**125** and **126**), digits **5** and **6** are not present in the secret number.\n- Combining these insights, the secret number likely starts with **1** in position 1, **2** in position 2, and the third digit must be either **0** or **3**, but not in their guessed positions from guess six. Since **0** was guessed in position 1 and **3** in position 3, the third digit in the secret number must be **3** (as **0** cannot be in position 1 and there's no position left for it).\n\nTherefore, the most probable secret number is **123**. However, since in the first guess **123** resulted in 1 bull and 1 cow, and based on the deductions above, the next logical guess is to try **132** to verify the position of **3**.\n\nGUESS:132"

Since **1** cannot be in the first position and is already correctly placed in the third position (from the bulls), this implies:\n  - **7** is correctly placed in the **first** position.\n  - **8** is **not** in the second position (as there are no cows), meaning it is **not** in the secret number.\n  - **1** is correctly placed in the **third** position.\n  \n- Therefore, the secret number has the format **7 _ 1**, where the middle digit must be a digit that hasn't been ruled out. The only remaining digit from the possible candidates (**1, 7, 8, 9**) is **9**.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The secret number is **7 9 1**.\n\nGUESS: 791"
